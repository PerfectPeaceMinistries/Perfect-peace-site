    <p class="verse">“He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.”<br>— 1 Peter 1:3</p>

    <p>Hope in this world is often uncertain—built on fragile things that fade, fail, or change. But the hope we have in Christ is not a wish. It is living. It is grounded in a historical event: the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.</p>

    <p>Because Christ lives, our hope lives. It breathes. It holds. It endures through suffering, sorrow, and seasons of silence. We are not hoping in ideas or ideals, but in a risen Savior who intercedes for us, walks with us, and promises to return.</p>

    <p>This living hope sustains us when we feel the weight of the world. It reminds us that death is not the end, failure is not final, and pain is not purposeless. We belong to the God of mercy, and His mercy has given us new birth into a future that cannot be shaken.</p>

    <p>Let the world chase shadows—we have a living Savior.</p>

    <p class="reflection">Reflection:</p>
    <p>Where do you look for hope when life feels uncertain?<br>
    Are you resting in the risen Christ or reaching for things that cannot hold?</p>

    <p class="prayer">Closing Prayer:<br><br>
    Risen Lord, thank You for being my living hope. When my heart grows heavy, anchor me in Your promises. When all else fades, remind me that You never will. I trust in you. You are my hope. You are my God. Amen.</p>
