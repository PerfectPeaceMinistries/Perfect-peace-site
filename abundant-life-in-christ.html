    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.”<br>— John 10:10 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Jesus tells us that He came so that we may have life—and not just a nominal existence, but an abundant life. Some translations say, “a life to its fullness.” Not only does Christ bring us from death to life, but He gives us a complete life, lacking in nothing.</p>

    <p>He wasn’t promising an easier path or a life free from pain. He wasn’t promising health, material wealth, or even marriage and children—though He may bless us with any of those things. He was revealing something far greater: a life filled with His presence, His peace, and His purpose.</p>

    <p>Many chase abundance in the form of possessions, pleasure, or success. But the life Jesus offers runs deeper than circumstance. It is not measured in wealth or comfort, but in the nearness of God Himself. True abundance begins the moment we enter into relationship with Christ—when our hearts are made alive by His Spirit and our souls find their home in Him.</p>

    <p>Abundant life is a life <strong>rooted in relationship</strong>. It’s not a list of achievements or blessings, but a daily walk with the Savior. It’s knowing Him, hearing His voice, and trusting His heart. In John 17:3, Jesus defined eternal life as knowing the Father—not merely existing forever, but living in intimate fellowship with the One who created us.</p>

    <p>It is also a life <strong>anchored in peace</strong>—perfect peace, if you will. The storms will still come—losses, trials, temptations, disappointments—yet the believer who abides in Christ discovers a peace that “surpasses understanding.” The world cannot give it, and circumstances cannot take it away. Abundant life doesn’t remove the storm; it steadies us through it.</p>

    <p>Abundant life is a life <strong>rich with purpose and fruitfulness</strong>. When we abide in the Vine, our lives bear fruit—love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, and faithfulness. We no longer live for fleeting pleasures or shallow pursuits, but for the glory of God. Even the smallest acts of faithfulness take on eternal significance when done for Him.</p>

    <p>It is a life <strong>marked by freedom</strong>—freedom from sin’s grip, from the burden of guilt, from fear and comparison. The abundant life Jesus offers is one where the soul finally breathes freely, because the chains are broken. “If the Son sets you free,” He said, “you will be free indeed” (John 8:36).</p>

    <p>And finally, abundant life <strong>overflows toward others</strong>. The love of Christ never stops with us; it spills outward in generosity, compassion, and grace. The more we experience His abundance, the more we desire to share it—through kindness, forgiveness, and the testimony of a life transformed.</p>

    <p>In short, abundant life is not about having more of the world. It’s about having more of <em>Him</em>. It’s a life that overflows with meaning, peace, and joy because it is centered on Christ Himself—the Good Shepherd who came not only to save, but to fill every moment of our existence with eternal purpose.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you usually define “abundance” in your own life?</li>
      <li>Which aspect of abundant life—relationship, peace, purpose, freedom, or overflow—do you most desire to grow in right now?</li>
      <li>What would change in your daily outlook if you believed you already have everything you need in Christ?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for the life You came to give—life that is rich, full, and everlasting. Teach me to rest in Your presence and to see abundance not in what I possess, but in who You are. Fill my heart with Your peace, anchor my soul in Your truth, and help me live each day with gratitude and purpose. May Your love overflow from me into the lives of others, that they too may taste the abundance found only in You. Amen.</p>
