    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’
      Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”
      —2 Corinthians 12:9 (ESV)
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is a paradox at the heart of the Christian life: we grow stronger by becoming weaker. The world exalts strength, independence, and self-sufficiency, but God delights to work through the humble and the broken. He does not need our might—He wants our dependence.</p>
    <p>The apostle Paul learned this firsthand. He pleaded with the Lord to remove the “thorn in the flesh,” a persistent affliction that kept him weak. But God did not take it away. Instead, He gave Paul something better: grace. Sustaining, sanctifying, soul-strengthening grace.</p>
    <p>Our trials, our struggles, and even our failures all serve a divine purpose. They strip us of pride. They shatter illusions of self-reliance. They bring us to the end of ourselves—and that is precisely where God meets us with power. When we have nothing left, Christ becomes our everything.</p>
    <p>In suffering, faith is refined. In hardship, character is forged. God is not absent in our affliction—He is present, strengthening us in it. As Peter writes, trials are the testing of our faith, more precious than gold, so that the genuineness of our trust in Christ may be seen (1 Peter 1:6–7).</p>
    <p>And when others see us endure hardship with unwavering hope in God, they are encouraged. Our pain becomes a testimony. Our endurance points to the sustaining grace of Christ. Our weakness becomes a window through which His strength shines.</p>
    <p>This is not just personal—it’s pastoral. It helps others. Your quiet perseverance in the storm is not wasted. It’s worship.</p>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Where are you weak today? What affliction or burden weighs heavy on you? Bring it to the Lord—not with shame, but with confidence. His grace is sufficient. Let your weakness drive you to His strength.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Am I trying to carry what only God can sustain?</li>
      <li>Do I see my trials as opportunities for Christ’s power to be displayed?</li>
      <li>Is someone watching my faith as they walk through their own valley?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Boast in your weakness—not because it is good in itself, but because it brings glory to Christ. Let your struggle become a sermon of His sufficiency.</p>
    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You that Your strength is made perfect in my weakness. Help me to stop striving in my own power and instead rest in Your grace. In every trial, teach me to trust You more. Let my life be a testimony to Your sustaining power. May others see my hope in You and be encouraged. In Jesus’ name I pray, amen.</p>
