    <h1>Introduction to the Names of God</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>The Scriptures overflow with titles and descriptions of the living God—well over six-hundred by some counts. Each name is a window into His being, revealing facets of His power, providence, mercy, and holiness. When we study these names we do more than collect information; we encounter the Person behind the titles. We exchange vague ideas about “God” for concrete glimpses of His heart. As we grow familiar with His names, we begin to pray, worship, and trust Him more personally—calling on the very attributes He has chosen to disclose.</p>

    <p>Below is the concise roster we will explore in this series, along with an English sense of each name. Think of it as a map for the journey ahead; we will unpack the riches of every title in the coming lessons.</p>

    <h3>Names for this study:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>YHWH (Yahweh)</strong> – I AM WHO I AM, the self-existent, covenant-keeping LORD</li>
      <li><strong>Adonai</strong> – Lord, Master, Sovereign</li>
      <li><strong>El / Elohim</strong> – God, Mighty One, Creator</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah</strong> – Traditional vocalization of YHWH – the LORD</li>
      <li><strong>El Elyon</strong> – God Most High</li>
      <li><strong>El Roi</strong> – God Who Sees (me)</li>
      <li><strong>El Shaddai</strong> – God Almighty / All-Sufficient One</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Jireh</strong> – The LORD Will Provide</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Rapha</strong> – The LORD Who Heals</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Nissi</strong> – The LORD My Banner (Victor)</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Mekoddishkem</strong> – The LORD Who Sanctifies You</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Shalom</strong> – The LORD Our Peace</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Sabaoth</strong> – The LORD of Hosts (Commander of angelic armies)</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Rah (Raah)</strong> – The LORD My Shepherd</li>
      <li><strong>Jehovah Tsidkenu</strong> – The LORD Our Righteousness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>May this overview whet our appetite to know the God whose names testify to every grace we need. In the coming sessions we’ll linger over each title, trace it through Scripture, and consider how it shapes our daily walk with Christ.</p>

    <p>Grace and peace to you as we begin.</p>
