    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” — Micah 6:8 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Humility is not self-hatred or insecurity—it is seeing ourselves rightly before a holy God. It is recognizing that apart from Christ, we are nothing but dust and rebellion. Every good thing in us is not our own achievement but the outworking of Christ’s life within.</p>

    <p>Micah 6:8 reminds us that what the Lord desires from His people is not lofty ambition or outward show, but a heart that walks humbly with Him. Pride puffs us up, but humility bows low. Pride robs God of glory, but humility gives it back.</p>

    <p>The truth is sobering: left to ourselves, we are not good people needing a little improvement—we are dead in sin, utterly dependent on grace. But God, being rich in mercy, made us alive together with Christ. Now, anything virtuous, anything noble, anything praiseworthy in us is Christ in us—the hope of glory.</p>

    <p>The humble heart says, “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory” (Psalm 115:1). It does not seek applause but lives to reflect the goodness of God. It serves quietly, loves deeply, and obeys faithfully—not for praise, but because He is worthy.</p>

    <p>May we never forget: the moment we begin to boast in ourselves, we’ve lost sight of the Cross. Let us daily kneel at the foot of that Cross, where the proud are humbled and the humble are lifted up.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I live with a daily awareness that all good in me is Christ?</li>
      <li>In what areas am I tempted to seek recognition or take credit?</li>
      <li>How can I walk more humbly before the Lord today?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, You are the good One. All that is righteous in me is from You. Apart from You, I have nothing, I am nothing, I can do nothing. Keep me from pride. Teach me to walk lowly before You, to delight in giving You all the glory. Let Christ be magnified in my weakness and honored in my obedience. In His precious name I pray, Amen.</p>
