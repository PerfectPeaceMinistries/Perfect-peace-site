    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.” — 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>Gratitude is more than a polite “thank you” — it is the posture of a heart that sees God’s hand in all things. When Paul tells us to “give thanks in all circumstances,” he is not suggesting that every situation will feel pleasant or desirable. In fact, we are promised suffering and persecution, but he is reminding us that God is sovereign over every detail of our lives, and that His purposes are always good. Understanding that all things are not just used for our good, but are in fact necessary in order to conform us to Christ, then we can thank God in all circumstances.</p>

    <p>Gratitude shifts our focus from what we lack to what we have already received in Christ. It anchors us in the truth that God’s grace is enough, His mercies are new every morning, and His blessings are countless — even in seasons of hardship. A thankful heart resists bitterness and despair because it chooses to dwell on God’s faithfulness instead of life’s frustrations.</p>

    <p>When we practice daily thanksgiving, we are not only obeying God’s will but also strengthening our faith. Gratitude reminds us that we are never abandoned, never forgotten, and never without reason to praise.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What is one thing you can thank God for today, even if it feels small?</li>
      <li>How does a grateful heart change the way you view trials and difficulties?</li>
      <li>In what ways can you express gratitude to God and others this week?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for the countless blessings You pour into my life, both seen and unseen. Forgive me for the times I overlook Your goodness or focus only on what I lack. Teach me to give thanks in all circumstances, trusting that You are working for my good and Your glory. Fill my heart with joy that overflows in praise, no matter what season I am in. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
