    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.”<br>— Hebrews 12:6 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>We often associate discipline with punishment—but in the hands of our Heavenly Father, discipline is an act of profound love. Hebrews 12:6 reminds us that God's discipline is not rejection; it is evidence of our adoption. It proves we are His.</p>

    <p>A father who does not love his child allows them to wander into danger. But a loving father corrects, trains, and guides—even when it causes temporary discomfort. So it is with God. His discipline is never aimless or cruel. It is always purposeful, always wise, and always for our good. As verse 10 says, “He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His holiness.”</p>

    <p>Sometimes this discipline comes in the form of conviction—piercing our hearts over sin. Sometimes it comes as delayed blessings, painful circumstances, or pruning seasons. But every trial is tailor-made by the loving hand of a Father who is forming Christ in us.</p>

    <p>This truth flips our perspective. When we experience hardship, we should not say, “God must be distant.” Rather, we say, “God is near—He is shaping me.” Hebrews 12:11 says, “For the moment all discipline seems painful… but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.”</p>

    <p>Discipline is not a sign of God’s anger; it’s a sign of His fatherhood. He is not punishing us for sin—Christ bore that punishment fully on the cross. He is training us, refining us, sanctifying us. He is preparing us to walk in holiness, with a heart that reflects His.</p>

    <p>Let us not resist His discipline, but submit to it with trust. Let us remember, when the refining fire burns, we are not being consumed—we are being purified.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I recognize God’s hand of discipline in my life?</li>
      <li>How can I respond to trials with trust, knowing He is shaping me for holiness?</li>
      <li>Am I allowing His correction to produce the “peaceful fruit of righteousness”?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for loving me enough to correct me. Help me not to despise Your discipline or grow weary under it. Train me in righteousness. Shape me by Your wisdom and love. May I grow in holiness and reflect the character of Christ, knowing You are treating me as Your beloved child. Amen.</p>
