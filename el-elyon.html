    <h2>Key Verses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genesis 14:18-20</strong> – “Blessed be Abram by <em>God Most High</em> (El Elyon), Possessor of heaven and earth.”</li>
      <li><strong>Psalm 97:9</strong> – “For You, <strong>O LORD</strong>, are the <em>Most High</em> over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.”</li>
      <li><strong>Daniel 4:34-35</strong> – “I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven… I blessed the <em>Most High</em> and praised and honored Him who lives forever, for His dominion is an everlasting dominion…”</li>
      <li><strong>Philippians 2:9-11</strong> – “God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the <em>name above every name</em>, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow…”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p><strong>El Elyon</strong> means <em>“God Most High.”</em> The Hebrew root <em>ʿālâ</em> (“to ascend”) paints a picture of One who towers infinitely above every realm of being. <strong>His name is above all names. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. There is none beside Him, none above Him. He has no rival or competitor; none can challenge Him.</strong> From all eternity He has reigned in absolute supremacy, unthreatened and unchallenged.</p>

    <p>The title first appears when Melchizedek blesses Abram (Genesis 14). By calling the Lord <em>El Elyon, Possessor of heaven and earth</em>, he declares that every square inch of creation belongs to God. Centuries later, Nebuchadnezzar—humbled and stripped of power—confessed the same truth: <em>“He does according to His will among the host of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth; none can stay His hand”</em> (Daniel 4:35). Whether spoken by patriarchs, prophets, or pagan kings, the testimony is unanimous: <strong>El Elyon rules over all.</strong></p>

    <p>Scripture piles phrase upon phrase to magnify His majesty:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>“Exalted above the heavens”</em> (Psalm 57:5)</li>
      <li><em>“High and lifted up, who inhabits eternity”</em> (Isaiah 57:15)</li>
      <li><em>“The blessed and only Sovereign”</em> (1 Timothy 6:15)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the New Testament, this glory converges on Christ. The Father has <em>“highly exalted”</em> Jesus, granting Him “the name above every name” (Philippians 2:9). The angels, elders, and every creature burst into doxology: <em>“To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!”</em> (Revelation 5:13).</p>

    <p>Because God is <strong>Most High</strong>, our confidence is unshakable. Kings rise and fall, cultures shift, circumstances whiplash—but El Elyon remains enthroned. We bow in reverent awe, yet we also rest; the One who rules the cosmos is the same Father who shelters us beneath His wings (Psalm 91:1).</p>

    <p>So lift His name on high today. Echo the song of heaven:</p>

    <blockquote><strong>“Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!<br>
    Let Your glory be over all the earth!”</strong> (Psalm 57:11)</blockquote>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Do I truly live in awe of God’s supremacy?</p>
    <p>Do I recognize His sovereign rule over my life and the world around me?</p>
    <p>Do I rest in the truth that He is in control, even when all else seems uncertain?</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>El Elyon, God Most High, there is none like You. No one can rival Your power, Your glory, or Your rule. I worship You not just with words, but with my life. Reign over my thoughts, direct my steps, and fill me with holy reverence. Let all that I am lift Your name higher still. In the name of Jesus, the name above all names, Amen.</p>
