    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” — Psalm 119:11 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.” — Psalm 119:97 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>What if we treated our Bible like we do our cell phone? Carrying it everywhere. Protecting it carefully. Constantly looking at it. Picking it up first thing in the morning. If we lost it, frantically searching until it was found. That simple comparison challenges us to reflect: how much do we truly treasure God’s Word?</p>

    <p>Psalm 119 is a love song to Scripture. Over and over, the psalmist declares his delight, dependence, and devotion to God’s Word. He meditates on it day and night (v. 97), hides it deep within his heart to guard against sin (v. 11), and walks by its guiding light (v. 105). For him, God’s Word is not a dusty scroll on a shelf—it is his lifeline, his compass, his joy.</p>

    <p>The truth is, the Word of God is more essential than any device or possession we own. Our phones may connect us to people, but God’s Word connects us to Him. Our phones may provide us with information, but God’s Word gives us wisdom. Our phones may entertain us, but God’s Word sustains us with eternal life.</p>

    <p>To delight in God’s Word means more than reading it out of duty—it means hungering for it, cherishing it, and letting it shape every part of our lives. Like the psalmist, may we say: “I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word” (v. 16).</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I treasure God’s Word as my daily lifeline, or treat it as optional?</li>
      <li>What changes can I make to prioritize Scripture in my daily routine?</li>
      <li>How can I store God’s Word in my heart so it shapes my thoughts and actions?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for giving us the treasure of Your Word. Forgive me for the times I’ve neglected it or treated it lightly. Help me to hunger for Your truth, to delight in it, and to build my life upon it. Let Your Word be the lamp to my feet and the light to my path today. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
