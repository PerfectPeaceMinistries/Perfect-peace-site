    <h1>Romans 1: Paul’s Introduction and the Power of the Gospel</h1>

    <h2>1. Paul’s Introduction and Purpose (Romans 1:1–15)</h2>
    <p>Paul begins by introducing himself—not as a man of status or prestige, but as a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God (v. 1). His authority comes not from man but from Christ Himself, and the gospel he proclaims is not of his own making. It is the fulfillment of promises foretold by the prophets in the Holy Scriptures and accomplished in Jesus Christ, who is both fully God and fully man (vv. 2–4).</p>
    <p>He gives thanks to God for the Roman believers and commends their faith, which is being spoken of throughout the world (v. 8). Though Paul has not yet visited them, his longing is clear. In verse 11 he writes, “For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you.” This likely refers to the mutual edification and encouragement that comes through Christian fellowship. Paul desires to strengthen them and to be strengthened by them in return (v. 12). This is what bibl...
    <p>This letter is intended to pave the way for his visit. It lays the theological groundwork for unity in the gospel and prepares the church to understand and proclaim the righteousness of God.</p>

    <h2>2. The Gospel: God’s Power for Salvation (Romans 1:16–17)</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Paul’s message is this declaration:</p>
    <p><em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes…”</em> (v. 16)</p>
    <p>The gospel is not just good advice—it is the very power of God to save. It is effective. It changes hearts. It awakens the spiritually dead. And it is available to everyone who believes, Jew and Gentile alike.</p>
    <p>Salvation is by faith, not by works. As Paul says in verse 17, “The righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith.” This righteousness is not our own—it is Christ’s righteousness, credited to us by grace through faith. As Scripture says elsewhere, “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17). The gospel is the means through which God saves sinners.</p>

    <h2>3. The Wrath of God Against the Ungodly (Romans 1:18–23)</h2>
    <p>Paul shifts abruptly from the glory of the gospel to the reality of God’s wrath. Why is the gospel necessary? Because the world is steeped in ungodliness and unrighteousness.</p>
    <p><em>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men…”</em> (v. 18)</p>
    <p>And here is Paul’s powerful indictment: no one has an excuse. God’s existence is clearly seen in creation. His invisible attributes—His eternal power and divine nature—have been plainly perceived since the foundation of the world (vv. 19–20). Just as a building proves the existence of an architect, so creation screams the reality of a Creator. Those who deny this truth are not intellectually confused—they are morally rebellious. They suppress the truth because their hearts love darkness.</p>
    <p>Paul writes that these people “exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images” (v. 23). They turned from the living God to idols—worshiping what is created rather than the Creator.</p>

    <h2>4. God “Gave Them Up” to Their Lusts (Romans 1:24–28)</h2>
    <p>Because of their rebellion, God gave them up. This phrase appears three times:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity” (v. 24)</li>
      <li>“God gave them up to dishonorable passions” (v. 26)</li>
      <li>“God gave them up to a debased mind” (v. 28)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This does not mean God causes their sin—it means He removes His restraint. When people repeatedly reject the truth, God allows them to follow their desires to destruction. He hands them over to the consequences of their rebellion.</p>
    <p>Paul gets specific in verses 26–27. He describes how both women and men abandoned natural relations, becoming consumed with lust for one another. This is an unambiguous reference to homosexual behavior, which Paul describes as contrary to nature. There is no room for debate—Scripture is clear that homosexuality is a form of sexual immorality, and those who persist in it without repentance will not inherit the kingdom of God (see also 1 Corinthians 6:9–10).</p>

    <h2>5. The Outcome: A Debased Mind and Cultural Collapse (Romans 1:28–32)</h2>
    <p>In verse 28, Paul again says, “God gave them up…” Since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them over to a debased mind—a mind no longer capable of distinguishing right from wrong.</p>
    <p>The result is moral collapse:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are filled with all manner of unrighteousness—envy, murder, deceit, malice, gossip, arrogance, disobedience to parents, and more (vv. 29–31).</li>
      <li>Worst of all, they not only commit these sins, but they approve of others who do them (v. 32).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not just sin—it is celebrated sin. It becomes a culture-wide rebellion where evil is called good, and good is called evil.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Why the Gospel Is So Urgent</h2>
    <p>Romans 1 exposes the heart of fallen humanity and the justice of God’s wrath. Paul is laying the foundation for the gospel by showing us why we desperately need it. Every person, apart from Christ, is under the just condemnation of God.</p>
    <p>This chapter is not just a warning—it’s a wake-up call. The world is broken because it has rejected its Creator. But praise be to God: He has not left us in our sin. Through the gospel, the righteousness of Christ is offered freely to all who believe.</p>
