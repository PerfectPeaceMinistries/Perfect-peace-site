      <h2>The Ordo Salutis: Understanding the Order of Salvation</h2>
      <p>Salvation is the work of God alone from beginning to end. This view is known as <em>monergism</em>—in contrast to <em>synergism</em>, which teaches that salvation results from a cooperative effort between God and man. From eternity past to eternity future, the triune God plans, initiates, accomplishes, and applies redemption to His chosen people. Theologians have long referred to this divine process as the <em>ordo salutis</em>—Latin for “the order of salvation.” It does not describe the steps man takes toward God, but rather the gracious sequence by which God draws sinners to Himself and makes them new.</p>
      <p>This order should not be viewed as strictly chronological, since many of these acts occur almost simultaneously. It’s not as though one could watch each moment unfold in real time. Instead, the <em>ordo salutis</em> presents a logical sequence of events—a framework that shows how the saving work of God fits together. Each act flows from the one before it, forming a unified portrait of divine grace.</p>
      <p>In this series, <em>Doctrine Defined: Exploring Core Truths of Christianity</em>, we will be going over key theological concepts that all believers should know. We will begin by examining each stage of the <em>ordo salutis</em>. My aim is not merely to teach theology, but to deepen your worship as you behold the beauty and coherence of God’s redemptive plan.</p>

      <h3>Here’s how I understand the <em>ordo salutis</em>:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Election</strong> – God’s sovereign choice, before the foundation of the world, to redeem a people for Himself and conform them to Christ.</li>
        <li><strong>Regeneration</strong> – The Holy Spirit’s work of bringing life to the spiritually dead, enabling them to respond.</li>
        <li><strong>Effectual Calling</strong> – God’s inward summons that draws the regenerated heart to faith in Christ.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion</strong> – The Spirit-given response of repentance and faith, as the sinner turns from sin to the Savior.</li>
        <li><strong>Justification</strong> – God’s legal declaration that the believer is righteous through the finished work of Christ.</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption</strong> – The believer’s new standing as a beloved child of God and heir of eternal life.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanctification</strong> – The Spirit’s ongoing work of conforming believers to the image of Christ.</li>
        <li><strong>Perseverance</strong> – God’s sustaining grace that keeps His children secure until the end.</li>
        <li><strong>Glorification</strong> – The final transformation when believers are made perfect and dwell eternally with Christ.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I begin with <em>Election</em> (rather than <em>Foreknowledge</em>, as many do) because salvation originates in God’s eternal purpose, not in human will or merit. <em>Foreknowledge</em> is assumed with an omniscient God, but it’s important to understand that it refers not to foresight of human decision, but to divine intimacy and purpose. To include it as a separate step can suggest that God elects based on something foreseen in us, which is contrary to Scripture. Election is truly unconditional and rests solely on God’s will.</p>

      <p>I also place <em>Regeneration</em> before <em>Effectual Calling</em>, because dead men cannot hear the call of God unless they are first made alive by His Spirit. Once the heart is quickened, the sinner truly hears and responds to the voice of the Shepherd.</p>

      <p>Each term in this order reveals another facet of the gospel’s beauty. My prayer is that as we study these truths, you will see not only how God saves, but why—that His mercy might be praised and His grace adored.</p>
