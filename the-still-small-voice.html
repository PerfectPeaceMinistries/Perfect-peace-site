    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “…and after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.” (1 Kings 19:12, KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Elijah was hiding in a cave, weary and afraid. He had seen fire fall from heaven, had stood against hundreds of false prophets, and had run for his life. Now, isolated and disheartened, he longed to hear from God again. And God did speak—but not in the whirlwind or the fire. He came in a whisper. A still, small voice.</p>
    <p>Many believers wonder: Does God still speak today? And if so, how do we hear Him?</p>
    <p>Some will tell you that God no longer speaks at all—that the only voice we can or should hear is the voice of Scripture. And it’s true that Scripture is the final and sufficient authority. We do not need new revelation. We are not waiting for a “fresh word” to supplement the Bible. God’s Word is complete, infallible, and fully able to equip us for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16–17).</p>
    <p>Yet, God has not grown silent.</p>
    <p>He still leads, guides, comforts, and convicts His children—not through audible voices or mystical signs, but by His Spirit dwelling in us. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). His voice is not always loud, but it is unmistakable to those who walk with Him.</p>
    <p>The Spirit of God illuminates the Word of God. He brings Scripture to life in our hearts. He gives us discernment. He burdens us to pray. He prompts us to repent. He grants peace when we walk in His will and stirs restlessness when we begin to wander. He may shut one door and open another—not by coincidence, but by providence.</p>
    <p>God is not distant. He is not passive. He is not silent.</p>
    <p>He is Immanuel—God with us.</p>
    <p>And He is always working, always guiding.</p>
    <p>If you belong to Him, then you know what it means to be led—not by vague feelings, but by the Spirit aligning your heart with His Word. When we walk closely with Christ, the Spirit sharpens our conscience and shapes our desires. We begin to will what He wills, and love what He loves.</p>
    <p>But be warned: the enemy also whispers. Satan’s voice accuses, confuses, rushes, and condemns. God’s voice convicts, clarifies, brings peace, and draws us closer.</p>
    <p>We must test every impression against Scripture. If it contradicts the Word, it is not of God.</p>
    <p>So seek Him. Read His Word. Walk in the Spirit. And listen—not for thunder or spectacle, but for that quiet, faithful guidance that only a child of God can recognize.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Do you sense the Spirit’s leading in your life?</p>
    <p>Are you tuned in to His quiet guidance—or have the distractions of life drowned out His voice?</p>
    <p>Have you wrongly believed God was silent just because He wasn’t loud?</p>
    <p>He is near. He is present. He is speaking—through His Word, through His providence, and through the Spirit who lives in you.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Am I walking closely enough with God to hear His gentle nudges?</li>
      <li>Do I recognize the difference between emotional impulse and Spirit-led conviction?</li>
      <li>Have I submitted my decisions to His Word and His will?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for not leaving me in silence. You have spoken through Your Word, and You speak still by Your Spirit. Teach me to be still and know that You are God. Help me to discern Your voice from all others. Lead me in paths of righteousness for Your name’s sake. And when I am uncertain, let me rest in the peace that You are always near, always guiding. In Jesus’ name I pray, Amen.</p>
