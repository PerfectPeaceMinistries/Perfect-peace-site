    <h1>Chapter 6 – Spirit-Empowered Households and Holy Warfare</h1>
    <p>Paul begins chapter six with a focus on the family. He harkens back to the fifth commandment, reminding children to obey and honor their parents in the Lord, for this is right. Children are not born morally neutral—they are born into sin. Rebellion is in their very nature, and anyone who has raised children knows this firsthand. Disobedience isn’t just a phase; it’s a manifestation of the heart’s resistance to God-given authority. But Paul is clear that parents are not off the hook either. In verse 4, he instructs fathers not to provoke their children to anger. Discipline must be present in a godly home, but it must be paired with gentleness, consistency, and instruction in the Lord. Parents sin when they are harsh or unpredictable, crushing a child’s spirit rather than shaping their heart. Biblical parenting is a balancing act: firm, loving discipline alongside grace-filled instruction, all for the purpose of pointing children to Christ.</p>

    <p>In verses 5 through 9, Paul addresses bondservants and masters—a section often misunderstood. This is not a justification of slavery as practiced in modern history, such as the brutal, race-based slavery in early America. In fact, Paul condemns slave trading as sin in 1 Timothy 1:10. What he refers to here is the bondservant arrangement common in the ancient world, where a person would work to repay a debt or secure basic provision. Paul’s point is about gospel conduct within such social realities. Servants are called to work sincerely, as unto Christ, not merely to please men. Even in undesirable circumstances, their labor is seen and rewarded by God. Likewise, masters are commanded to treat their servants justly and without threats, remembering that both master and servant have the same Lord in heaven. The cross flattens all human hierarchies—before God, all stand on equal footing.</p>

    <p>Paul closes the book of Ephesians with a stirring call to spiritual warfare. “Finally,” he says, “be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.” We are not fighting flesh and blood, but spiritual forces of darkness—unseen, yet powerful enemies who seek to destroy faith and disrupt gospel work. To withstand these attacks, we must put on the full armor of God. This armor is not physical—it is spiritual, rooted in the Word and the disciplines of the Christian life. The belt of truth stabilizes us with God’s reality; the breastplate of righteousness guards our hearts through both Christ’s imputed righteousness and our pursuit of holiness. Our feet are to be fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace, allowing us to stand firm and move forward with confidence. The shield of faith protects us from the flaming lies of the enemy, while the helmet of salvation secures our mind with assurance of our eternal hope. Lastly, we take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God—our only offensive weapon. But this armor is only truly effective when fastened with prayer. Paul urges believers to pray at all times in the Spirit, with all perseverance. A prayerless soldier, no matter how well equipped, is vulnerable on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>Paul ends the letter with final encouragement, sending Tychicus to update and strengthen the believers. His benediction is rich: “Peace to the brothers, and love with faith… Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible.” The Christian life is war, but it is also a life filled with peace, love, faith, and grace—all flowing from Christ to those who remain in Him. Our enemy is real, but our victory is sure, for we stand not in our own strength, but in the power of God.</p>
