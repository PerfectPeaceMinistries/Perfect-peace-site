    <h1>The Way of Humility</h1>
    <h2>Theme Verse:</h2>
    <p><strong>“God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”</strong><br>—James 4:6</p>

    <h3>What Is Humility?</h3>
    <p>
        Humility is not a technique to earn grace. James 4:6 does not mean we humble ourselves to get something from God—
        it means that when we are truly broken, contrite, and consider others before ourselves, God is glorified. 
        Pride elevates and boasts in self, but humility sees self rightly in light of God’s holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humility is not thinking less of ourselves—it is thinking of ourselves rightly in comparison to who God is. 
        It is the recognition that we are weak, sinful, and utterly dependent on God for every breath, every gift, and every ounce of strength. 
        Apart from Christ, we are nothing—and all we are and all we accomplish is by His grace.
    </p>
    <p>
        True humility bows the heart. It kills pride. It lives in daily repentance. 
        And it moves us to serve others, because we know we are not above anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world says the strong rise by self-promotion. The kingdom of God says the weak rise by kneeling.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Does God Value Humility?</h3>
    <p>
        Because humility reflects the heart of Christ. It is the soil where grace grows. 
        God does not delight in the self-sufficient, but in the brokenhearted, the contrite, and those who tremble at His Word.
    </p>
    <p>
        He chooses the lowly to shame the proud, the weak to display His strength, and the broken to magnify His power. 
        He gets the glory when it’s clear the vessel is not the source.
    </p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
        Man’s instinct is pride and self-exaltation, but God treasures and lifts up the lowly. 
        Are we daily putting to death pride and embracing our dependence on Him? 
        Do we serve quietly, love sacrificially, and speak little of ourselves?
        <br><br>
        What do you have that was not given? What can we boast in but the cross of Christ?
    </div>

    <div class="closing-prayer">
        <strong>Prayer:</strong><br>
        Lord, You are high and holy, yet You dwell with the humble. Teach me to walk low before You. Kill my pride. 
        Remind me daily that all good in me is from You, and apart from You I am nothing. 
        Help me to serve others gladly, and give You the glory always. Amen.
