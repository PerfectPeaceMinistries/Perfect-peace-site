      <h2>Propitiation</h2>

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <blockquote class="kv">“God put forward [Christ] as a propitiation by His blood, to be received by faith.” — Romans 3:25 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="kv">“He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.” — 1 John 2:2 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="kv">“In this is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” — 1 John 4:10 (ESV)</blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p><strong>ἱλαστήριον</strong> (<em>hilastērion</em>) — atonement, expiation; the turning away of wrath by satisfying justice; an appeasement of divine judgment.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>Propitiation refers to Christ’s work in bearing the full measure of God’s holy and righteous wrath against sin on our behalf. Because God is perfectly just, sin must be punished. Because He is perfectly holy, sin cannot dwell in His presence. Justice demands payment, and holiness demands cleansing.</p>
      <p>At the cross, Christ became our substitute — the spotless Lamb who absorbed the penalty that belonged to us. He satisfied the wrath of God fully and finally. Propitiation does not mean that Christ changed the Father’s heart from anger to love; rather, it reveals that the Father Himself, out of love, provided the sacrifice that satisfied His own justice.</p>
      <p>God’s wrath is not like human rage — unpredictable, emotional, or petty. It is His settled, righteous opposition to all evil. Sin demands judgment, and Christ willingly stepped into the place where that judgment would fall. Through His blood, He satisfied divine justice, upheld God’s perfect righteousness, and made a way for sinners to be reconciled to God without compromising His holiness.</p>
      <p>At the mercy seat in the Old Testament — the <em>hilastērion</em> — the blood of a spotless substitute covered the people’s sin. This pointed forward to the spotless and perfect Christ, our true mercy seat, whose blood does not merely cover sin but removes it. For all who believe in Him, condemnation has already been poured out. There is no wrath left.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>Propitiation teaches believers that their standing before God is secure because Christ’s sacrifice is complete. The punishment due to us has already been borne. We no longer live in fear of paying for our sins, for Christ has already paid in full. We don’t approach God as trembling criminals but as children welcomed by a Father whose justice has been satisfied.</p>
      <p>This truth also humbles us. We contributed nothing but the sin that made propitiation necessary; Christ contributed everything — His perfect obedience, His blood, His very life. The cross becomes the center of our confidence, and propitiation the anchor of our assurance. When accusations come, when guilt rises, when doubts whisper, “God is angry with you,” the believer rests in the certainty that wrath has already fallen — on Christ.</p>
      <p>A right understanding of propitiation stirs and fuels our worship. We marvel at a God who loved us enough to absorb His own judgment on our behalf. And it calls us to hate sin — not out of fear of punishment, but out of gratitude for the sacrifice that removed that punishment forever.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Propitiation assures us that God’s justice and love meet perfectly at the cross. In Christ, judgment is satisfied and mercy flows freely. The wrath we deserved has been exhausted, replaced with favor, fellowship, and everlasting peace.</p>
      <p>Until the day we stand before Christ face to face, we live each day remembering that there is now no condemnation for those who are in Him — because He became the propitiation for our sins.</p>

      <h3>Ask Yourself</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do I rest confidently in the finished work of Christ, knowing God’s wrath toward my sin has been satisfied?</li>
        <li>Does the reality of Christ’s sacrifice move me to deeper worship, obedience, and gratitude?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Father, thank You for sending Your Son to be the propitiation for my sins. Thank You that Your wrath has been fully satisfied and that I stand before You clothed in the righteousness of Christ. Help me to live in the peace, freedom, and assurance that His sacrifice has secured. Teach me to hate sin and love holiness, and move my heart to worship the One who bore my judgment. Amen.</p>
