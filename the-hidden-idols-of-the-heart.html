    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces.”<br>— Ezekiel 14:3 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>When we think of idols, our minds often turn to carved statues or pagan temples. But Scripture reminds us that the most dangerous idols are not made of wood or stone, but the ones set up in our hearts. An idol is anything we love, trust, or desire more than God. It can be family, success, comfort, reputation, even ministry. These things may be good in themselves, but when elevated to ultimate status, they quietly steal our devotion and dethrone Christ.</p>

    <p>The subtlety of hidden idols is what makes them so dangerous. Unlike outward sins, which are often visible to others, the idols of the heart can hide beneath layers of respectability. A pursuit of excellence at work can mask pride. A deep care for family can reveal control or misplaced security. Even our spiritual service can become about self-glory rather than God’s honor.</p>

    <p>God will not share His glory with another (Isaiah 42:8). This is why He calls us to examine our hearts regularly. The gospel confronts our idols by exposing them for what they are—false gods that cannot save—and by reminding us that only in Christ do we find true rest, satisfaction, and identity.</p>

    <p>When we root out these hidden idols, we make space for deeper worship. God’s love becomes sweeter, His promises more precious, and His presence more satisfying. He alone is worthy of our ultimate devotion.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What good things in your life are you tempted to elevate above God?</li>
      <li>Are there areas where your trust or sense of security rests more in people or possessions than in the Lord?</li>
      <li>How can you re-center your heart on Christ today?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, You know my heart better than I know myself. Reveal the hidden idols that I’ve allowed to take root. Forgive me for placing my trust and affection in things that cannot save. Give me the strength to tear them down, and help me to find my joy, rest, and identity in You alone. May my life be lived for Your glory. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
