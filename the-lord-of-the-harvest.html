    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Then He said to His disciples, ‘The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.’” — Matthew 9:37–38 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p>Today my family and I spent the day at a local farm for its annual harvest festival — a time full of laughter, hayrides, pony rides, fresh-squeezed lemonade, and fields bursting with pumpkins ready for harvest. My son Judge had a blast! His joy reminded me that these simple moments are gifts from the Lord, each one testifying to His faithfulness and provision. As I looked across the fields, I couldn’t help but think of how God Himself is called <em>the Lord of the harvest.</em></p>

    <p>Every harvest season tells a quiet story of His care. Seeds buried in the ground in spring produce in due time because of His design. Men plant, but God gives the growth. Rain falls, the sun shines, and fruit appears — all sustained by His hand. And just as He oversees the physical harvest, He is also tending to the spiritual one — drawing souls to Himself, maturing faith, and producing fruit in His people.</p>

    <p>When Jesus spoke of the harvest, He was not just talking about wheat or grain, but about hearts ready to receive the gospel. The same God who brings pumpkins from the soil can bring faith from a weary heart. He calls us to be workers in His field — to love, to share, to serve.</p>

    <p>As Thanksgiving approaches, I’m reminded that gratitude is our response to the Lord of the harvest. Every blessing, from the laughter of our children to the food on our tables, is evidence of His goodness. Let us thank Him not only for what He provides, but also for the privilege of being part of His greater harvest — the gathering of souls for His kingdom.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How has God shown His faithfulness in your own “harvest seasons”?</li>
      <li>In what ways can you be a laborer for the Lord of the harvest this week?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord of the harvest, thank You for every good gift that comes from Your hand. Teach me to see Your glory in the everyday — in the changing seasons, the laughter of family, and the blessings that surround me. Help me to labor faithfully in Your field, sharing Your love with those who need it most. Amen.</p>
