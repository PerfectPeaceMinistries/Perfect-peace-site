    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will.” — Ephesians 1:11 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“The Lord of hosts has sworn: ‘As I have planned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand.’” — Isaiah 14:24 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.” — Proverbs 19:21 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“A man’s steps are ordained by the Lord; how then can a person understand his way?” — Proverbs 20:24 (NASB 2020)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Yesterday I opened up about my bipolar disorder, including a recent episode of mania and psychosis. That devotional was based on 2 Timothy 1:7, which tells us that God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. In it, I said that it was not God who sent my psychosis—because that spirit of fear and confusion is not from Him.</p>

    <p>However, upon reflection, I realized my words might have given the impression that I believe my illness and suffering fell outside of God’s sovereign plan—and that is far from accurate. I am a firm believer that all things are ordained by the Lord, even evil, sin, and suffering.</p>

    <p>Scripture is clear that nothing happens by accident. God is certainly not surprised, or even passive in allowing our pain, illnesses, or even the most disorienting seasons of our lives. He governs all things according to His will and wisdom (Ephesians 1:11). My psychosis was not outside His control. He did not abandon me to chaos. He ordained it, just as He ordains every trial in the lives of His children, with a purpose known fully only to Him.</p>

    <p>So while the spirit of confusion and fear that overtook me was not from the Holy Spirit, the experience itself was still under the sovereign hand of my loving Father. He ordained the experience—not necessarily as punishment—but as refining fire, so that I might learn humility, dependence, and compassion toward others who suffer. What the enemy may have meant for destruction, God can and does turn for good (Genesis 50:20).</p>

    <p>This is the tension of faith: to trust that even when our minds falter, our God does not. He ordains both our joys and our sorrows for our sanctification and His glory. And in that truth, there is peace.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How can I learn to trust God’s hand even when I cannot trace His purpose?</li>
      <li>Do I truly believe that His sovereignty extends over my suffering as well as my blessing?</li>
      <li>What testimony might He be forming in me through this season?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, I thank You that nothing in my life is random. You are the Potter, and I am the clay. Even when my mind is clouded and my heart trembles, You remain sovereign and good. Help me to rest in Your control and to find comfort in knowing that every trial You ordain is part of Your loving plan. Let my weakness display Your strength, and let my confusion become a testimony of Your faithfulness. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
