      <h2>Key Verses</h2>
      <blockquote class="verses">
        <p>“And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, ‘Arise and eat.’” — 1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:5 (ESV)</p>
        <p>“Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise Him, my salvation.” — Psalm&nbsp;42:5 (ESV)</p>

      <h2>Devotion</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>Mental health can often be a difficult topic to talk about. Not only are there still people who don’t believe in mental illness, but even those who do often struggle to fully understand it. Someone like me, who lives with bipolar disorder, can at times feel alone, misunderstood, or even judged. Yet did you know there are examples in Scripture that speak to mental and emotional health?</p>

        <p>The Bible doesn’t shy away from showing us moments of emotional strain and mental weariness — even among God’s most faithful servants. Scripture makes it clear that caring for our minds and hearts is part of walking closely with Him.</p>

        <p>When Elijah fled into the wilderness after confronting the prophets of Baal, he collapsed beneath a broom tree and begged God to take his life. He was exhausted, afraid, and utterly spent. But the Lord didn’t scold him for weakness. Instead, He let Elijah rest. Then He sent an angel with food and water and told him, “Arise and eat.” Only after Elijah had rested and regained strength did God speak to him in a “still small voice.” This moment reveals that God understands human frailty — He provides rest before giving direction.</p>

        <p>David, too, knew the deep ache of a troubled soul. His psalms are filled with raw honesty — cries of despair, fear, and longing. Yet through his anguish, he continually returned to the same refrain: “Hope in God.” David’s example shows us that expressing our emotions to the Lord isn’t faithless — it’s faithful. Lament is not the opposite of trust; it’s the brokenness that often opens the door to renewed hope.</p>

        <p>And even Jesus, the perfect Son of God, modeled balance for us. After long days of ministry, He often withdrew to quiet places to pray. He stepped away from the crowds, sought solitude, and spent time with His Father. If the Savior Himself made space for rest, reflection, and renewal, then so should we.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>God knows our limits and cares deeply for our mental and emotional well-being. Resting, praying, and being honest about our pain aren’t signs of weakness — they’re acts of worship. When life feels heavy, remember Elijah under the broom tree, David crying out in the night, and Jesus retreating to pray. The Lord meets His people where they are — weary, honest, and seeking peace.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>Lord, thank You for caring not just for my soul, but for my mind and emotions too. Teach me to rest when I am weary, to pour out my heart honestly before You, and to find quiet moments to be still in Your presence. Renew my strength and help me walk each day with peace of mind and heart through Christ. Amen.</p>
      </div>
