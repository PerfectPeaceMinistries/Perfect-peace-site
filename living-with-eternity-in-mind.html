    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.”<br>— Colossians 3:2 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>The Christian life is not merely about surviving the present moment—it is about pressing on toward an eternal inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading (1 Peter 1:4). Paul urges believers to fix their minds not on the fleeting pleasures and trials of this world but on the reality of heaven, where Christ reigns and where our true home awaits.</p>

    <p>To live with eternity in mind is to recognize that everything we do here echoes into forever. The decisions we make, the temptations we resist, the acts of obedience we embrace—all are bound up in our calling as heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17). It is not enough to profess faith; we are called to persevere in holiness, keeping our eyes on Jesus, “the founder and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2).</p>

    <p>Abstaining from sin is not about earning salvation, but about treasuring our inheritance. Just as an athlete disciplines himself to win a crown that fades, we discipline ourselves for an eternal crown of glory (1 Corinthians 9:25). Every act of self-denial for Christ’s sake, every refusal to bow to idols of comfort or desire, every sacrifice made in obedience, is a step toward the fullness of the inheritance that has been promised.</p>

    <p>When the world entices us to live only for today, we must remember: this world is not our home. Our true reward lies ahead, in the presence of the Lord who will say, “Well done, good and faithful servant… enter into the joy of your master” (Matthew 25:21).</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What daily distractions tend to draw your eyes away from eternity?</li>
      <li>How can remembering your eternal inheritance help you resist present temptations?</li>
      <li>Are there areas of your life where God is calling you to practice self-denial for the sake of future glory?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, fix my heart on the inheritance You have promised. Teach me to live each day with eternity in view, resisting sin and pursuing holiness. Give me strength to persevere in faith and joy until the day I see You face to face. Amen.</p>
