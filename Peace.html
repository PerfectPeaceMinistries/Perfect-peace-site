    <h1>Peace</h1>

    <p><em>“The Lord bless you, and keep you; The Lord cause His face to shine on you, And be gracious to you; The Lord lift up His face to you, And give you peace.”</em></p>
    <p><strong>— Numbers 6:24–26 (NASB2020)</strong></p>

    <p>The Hebrew word for “peace” here is <em>shalom</em>. <em>Shalom</em> means more than just the absence of conflict—it speaks of wholeness, well-being, harmony, and right relationship. It is the kind of peace that can only come through Christ. His work in securing our salvation and making us right before God gives us a peace that cannot be shaken. No matter the season, we can say, <em>“It is well with my soul.”</em></p>

    <p><em>“Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</em> — Romans 5:1</p>

    <p>Because of Jesus, the broken relationship between us and God has been made whole. He is the fulfillment of the peace promised in Numbers—the lifted face of God, turned toward us in love.</p>

        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
        Take time each day to dwell on the peace you’ve been given. Life gets busy, and distractions are constant, but deep within us lies a peace that is eternal.</p>
