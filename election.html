      <h2>Election: God’s Sovereign Choice</h2>

      <h3>Key Verse</h3>
      <p>“…though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls.” — Romans 9:11 (ESV)</p>

      <h3>Term</h3>
      <p><strong>Election (ἐκλογή)</strong> — <em>divine selection</em>.</p>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>Election is the sovereign act of God by which He chooses, according to His own purpose and grace, certain individuals to receive salvation in Christ. It is not based on foreseen faith, human merit, or works, but upon the free and loving will of God.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>The Greek word <em>ἐκλογή</em> means “divine selection.” Scripture uses this term to describe God’s eternal purpose to save a people for Himself. Before the foundation of the world, He set His affection upon those He would redeem—not because of anything within them, but solely because it pleased Him to do so (Ephesians 1:4–5).</p>

      <p>Paul illustrates this profound truth in Romans 9 through the story of Jacob and Esau. The twins had the same parents, shared the same womb, and were conceived at the same time. Yet before either had done anything good or bad, God declared, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” (Romans 9:13). This was not a reflection of partiality or cruelty—nor hatred as understood today—but of divine purpose and preference, “in order that God’s purpose of election might stand” (v. 11).</p>

      <p>Election reveals a God who acts freely and righteously, displaying mercy to whom He will show mercy. This truth humbles the proud, silences all boasting, and exalts grace as the foundation of salvation:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “For he says to Moses, ‘I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.’ So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.” — Romans 9:15–16 (ESV)
      </blockquote>

      <p>The term <strong>elect (ἐκλεκτός)</strong> means “the chosen.” Throughout the New Testament, believers are described as the <em>ἐκλεκτοί</em>—those chosen by God for salvation (Colossians 3:12; 1 Peter 1:1–2). To be among the elect is not to take pride in being favored, but to marvel at undeserved grace. The elect are called to walk worthy of their calling, reflecting the holiness of the One who chose them.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>The doctrine of election is not meant to breed arrogance or superiority, but worship and assurance. It teaches that our salvation rests not in our unstable hands and fickle hearts, but in the eternal, unchanging will of God. Knowing we were chosen by grace before we were born should produce deep gratitude and a desire to live for His glory.</p>

      <p>Rather than question God’s fairness, we are invited to trust His wisdom and sovereign plan. Election magnifies His mercy and sovereignty and displays the beauty of grace—that salvation is entirely of the Lord, leaving us nothing to boast about in ourselves.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Pause and consider: before you ever drew breath, before you ever sought God, He set His love upon you. How might this truth change the way you approach Him in prayer, worship, and daily obedience?</p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Sovereign Lord, thank You for choosing me—not because of who I am or what I have done, but because of Your mercy and grace. Teach me to rest in Your purpose and to walk humbly as one called by Your name. Let my life reflect the gratitude and holiness fitting for one of Your elect. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
