    <h2>Donation Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Perfect Peace World Ministries is not currently a registered 501(c)(3) organization. As such, donations are not tax-deductible at this time.</p>

    <p>We believe in financial transparency and faithful stewardship. Every dollar received through this ministry is prayerfully distributed to missionaries around the world—men and women of God with whom we have personally connected through the work of this ministry. Funds may also be directed to support established missionaries sent out by our home church to serve in places such as Haiti, India, Kenya, Uganda, and beyond.</p>

    <p>These faithful servants are engaged in various ministries—including orphanages, women’s support centers, food pantries, and other outreach efforts—often operating with very limited resources. It is our joy to support them in obedience to the Great Commission.</p>

    <p>Your gift will go directly to these missions efforts—not to overhead, staff salaries, or organizational maintenance. We are committed to using all donations solely for the advancement of the Kingdom through gospel-centered, Christ-exalting missions.</p>

    <p>Thank you for partnering with us in this work.</p>
