    <h1>Chapter&nbsp;4 – Walking Worthy of the Calling</h1>

    <p>In chapter 4, Paul shifts from deep theological truths to practical Christian living. He begins with an urgent call to action: “walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called” (<em>v.1</em>). This marks a transition from doctrine to duty—from what God has done for us in Christ to how we are to respond in faithful obedience.</p>

    <p>We are no longer who we once were. We’ve been made alive in Christ, reborn by the Spirit. Therefore, our lives must reflect the transformation we’ve received. Paul urges believers to walk with humility, gentleness, patience, and love—“eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (<em>v.3</em>). We should not be argumentative, harsh, or contentious. We should not be constantly complaining or stirring up division. The Spirit-filled life is marked by peace and grace.</p>

    <p>Paul emphasizes unity in the body of Christ—“one body, one Spirit… one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all” (<em>vv.4–6</em>). Our unity flows from our shared salvation and shared Savior. This unity is not something we create—it is something we maintain.</p>

    <p>In verses 11–13, Paul explains that Christ has given the church leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers—for a specific purpose: to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ. These leaders are not meant to do all the ministry themselves, but to prepare the rest of the church to serve. This is how the body grows and matures—each member doing its part, working together in love and truth.</p>

    <p>Paul then makes a contrast between the old self and the new self. He says we must no longer walk as the Gentiles do—“in the futility of their minds” (<em>v.17</em>). That way of life is darkened, alienated from God, and driven by deceitful desires. But that is not the way we have learned Christ. We are called to “put off the old self” and “put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness” (<em>vv.22–24</em>). The Christian life is one of continual renewal, daily dying to sin and walking in newness of life.</p>

    <h2>Practical Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Speak the truth, not lies.</li>
      <li>Be angry and do not sin—do not let the sun go down on your anger.</li>
      <li>Do not steal, but work honestly and share with others.</li>
      <li>Let no corrupting talk come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up (v.29).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the essence of Christian speech: edify, encourage, uplift. Our words should not tear others down, should not insult or curse, but should minister grace to those who hear.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”<br/>
      — Ephesians 4:32
    </blockquote>

    <p>We are never more like our Lord than when we forgive. Just as Christ forgave us—freely, fully, undeservedly—so must we forgive others. Forgiveness is not weakness; it is divine strength.</p>
