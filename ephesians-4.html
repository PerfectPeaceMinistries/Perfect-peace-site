    <h1>Chapter&nbsp;4 – Unity and Maturity</h1>

    <p>Paul opens chapter 4 with an urgent appeal: “walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called” (v. 1). This sets the tone for the remainder of the letter. The first three chapters focused on doctrine—God’s eternal plan, grace, and the mystery of the gospel. But now, Paul turns to how we should live in light of those truths.</p>

    <p>The Christian life is not lived in isolation. Paul emphasizes unity within the body of Christ, urging believers to live with humility, gentleness, patience, and love, “eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (v. 3). The foundation of our unity is theological: “one body… one Spirit… one hope… one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all” (vv. 4–6). Unity is not something we create; it is something we are called to preserve.</p>

    <p>Yet within this unity, there is diversity. Christ has gifted each believer uniquely for the building up of the church. Paul quotes Psalm 68 to speak of Christ’s victory and His distribution of gifts to His people (v. 8). These gifts include apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers (v. 11). Their purpose? “To equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ” (v. 12).</p>

    <p>God’s goal is that we would all “attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood” (v. 13). Maturity in Christ is the aim, and that means growing in truth, love, and Christlikeness. We are not to be children tossed about by every new doctrine or deception. Instead, we are to speak the truth in love and grow up into Christ, our Head (vv. 14–15).</p>

    <p>The second half of the chapter contrasts our old life with our new life in Christ. Paul reminds the Ephesians that they “must no longer walk as the Gentiles do” (v. 17), darkened in understanding and alienated from God. They are to put off the old self, corrupted by deceitful desires, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness (vv. 22–24).</p>

    <p>Paul ends the chapter with a call to integrity, honesty, and kindness. Put away falsehood. Do not let the sun go down on your anger. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit. Be kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving, “as God in Christ forgave you” (v. 32). This is the fruit of the Spirit’s work in us—the evidence of a transformed life.</p>
