    <!-- Key Verse -->
    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.”<br>
      — Isaiah 40:31&nbsp;(ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Lesson -->
    <p>Waiting on the Lord is not a vague or mystical idea—it is as simple and profound as it sounds. It means to anticipate, to remain steady, to hold our ground with hope until the Lord acts, speaks, moves, or reveals what’s next. We do not demand or dictate His timing. We trust it.</p>

    <p>God does not unfold our lives all at once. He reveals His will step by step, often just enough light for the next faithful decision. Waiting on Him, then, is not passive; it is active endurance. It is continuing to obey in the absence of clarity. It is resisting the urge to take matters into our own hands. It is living today in light of what we know is promised tomorrow.</p>

    <p>While we wait, we wage war. The Christian life is not a lounge—it is a battlefield. We engage in spiritual warfare against the lies of the enemy, the temptations of the world, and the cravings of our own flesh. We wait with a weapon in our hand and hope in our heart. Our eyes are fixed not on this passing age, but on the inheritance that awaits us—eternal rest with Christ, our King.</p>

    <p>To wait on the Lord is to believe that His timing is perfect, that His plans are good, and that His promises are sure. It is to know that He will return. He will make all things right. He will keep every word He has spoken. And until then—we wait.</p>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <div class="reflection">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What areas of my life feel slow, stalled, or silent? Am I trying to rush ahead of God’s timing?</li>
        <li>How can I grow stronger in obedience while I wait for God to act?</li>
        <li>Do I view waiting as wasted time—or as preparation?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing Prayer -->
    <div class="closing-prayer">
      <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
      <p>Lord, You are wise and good in all Your ways. Help me to trust You in the waiting. Teach me to walk in obedience even when I don’t see the full path ahead. Strengthen my heart when it grows weary. Keep my eyes fixed on eternity and remind me daily that You are faithful. I will wait for You. Amen.</p>
