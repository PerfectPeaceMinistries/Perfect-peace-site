    <h1>The Names of God: Jehovah</h1>
    <h2>Key Verse:</h2>
    <p><strong>“Those who know Your name will put their trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.”</strong><br>—Psalm 9:10 (NASB)</p>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>The name <strong>Jehovah</strong> is one of the most well-known names of God in the English-speaking world, yet its origin is somewhat misunderstood. In truth, <em>Jehovah</em> is not a separate name for God but a later vocalization of the divine name YHWH—the same name God revealed to Moses at the burning bush.</p>

    <p>The name <em>Jehovah</em> did not appear until the Middle Ages. Around the 8th century A.D., Jewish scribes known as the Masoretes began the work of preserving and standardizing the Hebrew Scriptures. They added vowel markings to the original consonantal Hebrew texts to help guide pronunciation. Out of deep reverence, the Jews refused to pronounce the sacred name YHWH. Instead, whenever they saw it in the text, they would say “Adonai,” meaning <em>Lord</em>.</p>

    <p>To prevent misreading, the Masoretes inserted the vowel points of <em>Adonai</em> into the consonants YHWH. This was a cue to readers to say “Adonai” aloud, rather than attempting to pronounce the divine name. When later scholars, particularly in Europe, came across these texts, they misunderstood the combination. Believing this mixture to represent the actual pronunciation of the name, they rendered it <strong>Jehovah</strong>—a blending of the consonants of YHWH (JHWH in German transliteration) with the vowels of Adonai.</p>

    <p>The term <em>Jehovah</em> first appeared in print around A.D. 1520 through the work of a Christian scholar named Galatinus. From there, the name gained traction, particularly among Protestant translators who were working to render the Scriptures into the languages of the people. Thus, <em>Jehovah</em> became a fixture in many early English Bibles, such as the Geneva Bible and the King James Version.</p>

    <p>Although <em>Jehovah</em> is not the original pronunciation of God’s covenant name, it still points us to the same eternal truth—the personal, self-existent God who reveals Himself and keeps covenant with His people. He is the “I AM,” the One who was, and is, and is to come.</p>

    <p>Whether we say <em>Yahweh</em>, <em>Jehovah</em>, or <em>the LORD</em>, what matters most is not the technical form of the name, but the God to whom it points—the Holy One of Israel, faithful and true.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <p>Let this remind us that God has made Himself known. He is not distant or silent. He has spoken, revealed His name, and entered into covenant with His people. The Lord is not merely a title—He is <strong>Jehovah</strong>, the personal God who calls us by name and invites us into relationship with Him.</p>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>O Lord Jehovah, we praise You for making Yourself known. You are not a distant force, but a personal God—faithful, eternal, and near. Teach us to revere Your name and to trust in Your covenant love. Help us to walk in Your truth and glorify You in all we do. Amen.</p>
