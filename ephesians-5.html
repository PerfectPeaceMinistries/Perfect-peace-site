    <h1>Chapter 5 – Walking in Love</h1>
    <p>Paul opens chapter 5 with a profound and difficult command: “Be imitators of God, as beloved children” (v. 1). We are to walk as Christ walked. Jesus is our example—He lived in perfect obedience, humility, truth, and love. Everything He did was motivated by love. So too, we must walk in love, offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God. Paul says, “Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us” (v. 2). That’s the model: sacrificial, selfless love.</p>
    <p>From there, Paul moves quickly into a strong warning against sexual sin. In verse 3, he says sexual immorality and impurity shouldn’t even be named among believers. The NIV words it sharply: there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality. That’s the standard. When it comes to sexual sin, we’re to live above reproach. Not even a shadow of compromise. God calls us to holiness. But what is sexual immorality? Sexual immorality is any sexual act or thought (Jesus told us we can lust in our heart, Matthew 5:28) outside the confines of marriage between one man and one woman. He defines marriage later in the chapter in verse 31, the man and woman become one flesh. Fornicators and homosexuals shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
    <p>Paul also warns us to watch our words in verse 4: “Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place.” If we sound like the world, how will anyone know we’ve been changed? Our speech should be different. No crude jokes, no vulgar talk. Our words should build up, reflect the Spirit within us, and show the kindness, gentleness, and gratitude that flow from a renewed heart.</p>
    <p>In verse 7, he reminds us that we are no longer in darkness. “At one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light” (v. 8). Our lives should reflect the holiness of God. We bear His name—we must live in a way that is worthy of our calling. Then, in verse 11, he takes it further: “Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.” We aren’t just to avoid sin—we are to expose it. Bring it to light. Let truth be known. Shine the light of God’s Word on the darkness around us, not with pride or condemnation, but with boldness and love.</p>
    <p>In verse 18, Paul gives a word about drunkenness: “Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit.” God calls us to be sober-minded. Drunkenness clouds judgment and weakens our ability to walk in obedience. Instead, we are to be filled with the Holy Spirit, controlled by Him, empowered by Him, sensitive to His leading.</p>
    <p>Then Paul shifts to the beauty of worship. In verses 19–20, he urges us to sing and worship together: “addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart.” We build one another up when we sing together. Worship stirs us toward good works. Corporate worship isn’t just a suggestion—it’s a command. Neglecting it is sin. God made us to sing to Him, and to sing together as His people. When we gather in worship, praising God side by side, it’s the closest taste of heaven on earth.</p>
    <p>In verse 21, he calls us to “submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.” That means living selflessly—putting the interests of others before our own. Then, in verse 22, Paul turns to marriage, saying: “Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.” The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the Church. This is God’s design. The husband is called to lead, to guide, and to be the spiritual authority in the home. He carries the weight of responsibility and will be held accountable before God.</p>
    <p>But this leadership is not about control or dominance—it’s about love. Paul commands husbands to “love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her” (v. 25). That’s a high calling. Christ died for His bride. He nourishes her, cherishes her, sanctifies her. A husband is to love his wife like that—with sacrifice, patience, and tenderness. Paul goes on to say that a man ought to love his wife as he loves his own body. Marriage is a union of mutual love and service. The wife is the man’s “help-mate” (Genesis 2:18). She complements him and supports him in his calling. But both husband and wife belong not to themselves, but to one another—and ultimately to God.</p>
    <p>Chapter 5 reminds us what it means to live a life that reflects the gospel. We walk in love. We walk in light. We walk in the Spirit. We live in worship, in holiness, in submission, and in love—because we are His, and He is worthy.</p>
