    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,
      but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.”<br>
      <strong>—Romans 12:3 (ESV)</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>
      The Christian life is not a competition. It is not a stage for performance, comparison, or pride. Rather,
      it is a walk of humility, obedience, and grace—each believer living according to the <em>measure of faith</em> that God Himself has appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not all called to be pastors, teachers, or missionaries. Some are given gifts that shine in public ministry,
      while others quietly labor in the background. Some are entrusted with deep wells of theological insight, while others
      struggle to memorize a single verse—yet live it out with quiet faithfulness day by day. Both are equally precious to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one with great passion and boldness has received such a gift from the Lord; the one with quiet steadiness and enduring trust—
      this too is from the Lord. “But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, <em>as He chose</em>” (1 Cor 12:18).
      We are not meant to be carbon copies of one another. We are members of one body, each with a different function (Rom 12:4–5).
    </p>
    <p>
      To some, God gives bold faith to step into the mission field. To others, He gives grace to provide, support, encourage, pray,
      or serve behind the scenes. “There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit… and it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone”
      (1 Cor 12:4–6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet all true believers—whether strong or weak in visible faith—are justified by the <em>same</em> righteousness of Christ.
      No measure of faith, no spiritual gift, no ministry role, no depth of knowledge makes one more or less saved than another.
      What matters is that we are faithful with what we have been given (see Matt 25:14–30).
    </p>
    <p>
      This truth frees us from envy and pride. We don’t need to compare; we don’t need to feel inferior or superior.
      The hand does not envy the eye, nor does the ear boast over the foot. Let each of us walk in the role and portion God has graciously entrusted,
      for He knows exactly what we need and is glorified through the unique expression of faith He assigns.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you ever compare your faith to that of others?</li>
      <li>Are you discouraged by your perceived weaknesses or envious of others’ strengths?</li>
      <li>How might a clearer view of God’s sovereignty over your gifts and faith help you walk more humbly and confidently?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="prayer">
      <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
      <p>
        Heavenly Father, thank You for the faith You have given me. Teach me to walk in humility and gratitude,
        not comparing myself to others but faithfully using what You’ve entrusted to me.
        Help me honor You in my unique role in the body of Christ. Whether I speak, serve, give, or pray—
        may I do all things by Your strength and for Your glory. In Jesus’ name, amen.
