    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”<br>— Matthew 11:28 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>Life has a way of wearing us down. The burdens we carry — worries about the future, pain from the past, and pressures of the present — can weigh heavily on our hearts. The world offers many ways to cope, but only one source promises true, soul-deep rest: Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>When Jesus said, “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest,” He wasn’t offering a temporary escape. He was inviting us into a relationship where our restless hearts find peace. This rest is more than physical relief; it is the deep assurance that our sins are forgiven, our future is secure, and our lives are in the hands of the One who loves us perfectly.</p>

    <p>To “come” to Jesus means to trust Him fully — to lay down our striving, self-reliance, and endless attempts to earn peace. It means we take His yoke upon us, learning from Him in humility and gentleness, and walking in step with His will. In doing so, we discover that His yoke is easy and His burden is light (Matthew 11:29–30).</p>

    <p>The rest Christ offers is not the absence of trouble but the presence of His sustaining grace in the midst of it. It is knowing that we are never alone, that He carries our burdens with us, and that His strength is enough for each day.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What burdens are you carrying today that you need to lay at Jesus’ feet?</li>
      <li>Are you seeking rest in temporary fixes, or are you coming to the One who can truly give it?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, I come to You today weary and in need of Your rest. I lay my burdens before You and trust that You will carry them. Teach me to walk in step with You, finding peace in Your presence. Thank You for Your promise to give rest to my soul. Amen.</p>
