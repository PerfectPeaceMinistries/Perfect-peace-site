  <div class="date">September 7, 2025</div>
  <p>The Christian life is not marked by the absence of suffering, but by a transformed perspective in the midst of it. James does not say “if” trials come, but “when.” Trials are not accidents in the believer’s life; they are instruments in the hand of a loving God...</p>

  <p>Life often feels uncertain. Our jobs, finances, health, and relationships can shift in an instant, leaving us anxious about tomorrow. Yet in the middle of this fragile world, God...</p>

  <div class="date">September 20, 2025</div>
  <p>Baptism is one of the most visible and meaningful acts of obedience for the follower of Christ. It does not save us—salvation is by grace alone through faith alone—yet it testifies to our new life in Him...</p>

  <div class="date">September 22, 2025</div>
  <p>Jesus calls us the salt of the earth and the light of the world. To shine in darkness and preserve in a tasteless world, we must stand out as different from the world, so that our message lands fruitfully and brings glory to God.</p>

  <p>What if we treated our Bible like we do our cell phone—carrying it everywhere, protecting it, and picking it up first thing in the morning? Psalm 119 reminds us that God’s Word is our lifeline, our compass, and our joy.</p>
