    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “O Lord GOD, You are the God who knows; Your servant has said this boldness only because You have revealed it to him.” —2 Samuel 7:20 (NASB)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>The name <strong>Adonai</strong> is a title of authority and reverence. In Hebrew, it is often translated simply as “<strong>Lord</strong>.” The root word <strong>“Adon”</strong> means lord, master, or ruler—one who exercises authority and ownership. The plural form, <strong>Adonai</strong>, appears over <strong>400 times</strong> in the Old Testament and is most often used to refer to God in a way that conveys both majesty and personal relationship.</p>
    <p>There is scholarly debate over the exact function of the plural ending “-ai.” Some suggest it is a grammatical construct known as the "plural of majesty"—a way of expressing greatness and splendor, not number. Much like the English use of capitalized titles (e.g., “Your Majesty”), this plural ending signifies not multiple gods, but the supreme and exalted nature of the one true God.</p>
    <p><strong>To call God “Adonai” is to confess:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>He is the Master, and we are His servants.</li>
      <li>He is the Ruler, and we are under His command.</li>
      <li>He has full rights of ownership over us—our lives, our time, our possessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When Abraham addressed God as “Adonai,” he was acknowledging that his life was not his own. When Moses called Him Adonai, he was surrendering to divine authority. When David prayed to Adonai, he was submitting his reign to the King above all kings.</p>
    <p>In our modern context, “Lord” can become a casual phrase—something we say without much thought. But in Scripture, to call God <strong>Adonai</strong> is no small thing. It is to surrender. It is to kneel. It is to recognize that we are not in control—and never were.</p>
    <p><strong>Adonai rules over all:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Over creation: "The earth is the LORD’s and the fullness thereof..." (Psalm 24:1)</li>
      <li>Over kings and kingdoms: “The Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will...” (Daniel 4:17)</li>
      <li>Over our personal lives: “You are not your own, for you were bought with a price.” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We often want God as Savior, but not as Master. Yet to know Him rightly is to embrace Him as both. Adonai is not a passive observer—He is the ruling Lord who guides, disciplines, blesses, and commands.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Do I recognize God’s authority in every area of my life?</p>
    <p>Have I submitted to His rule not just in word, but in action?</p>
    <p>Am I trying to be master of my own life, or have I acknowledged Him as Adonai?</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Adonai, You are Lord of all. I lay down my pride, my independence, and my illusion of control. Rule in me. Govern my thoughts, my desires, and my actions. May I serve You not just with my lips, but with my life. I trust Your leadership. I rest under Your authority. You are good, and You are King. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
