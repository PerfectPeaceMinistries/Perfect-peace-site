    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.” — Psalm 51:10 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>Repentance is not a single moment we experience at salvation and then move past—it is the ongoing posture of a heart that truly walks with God. While we are forgiven once for all through the finished work of Christ, the Christian life is marked by continual confession and repentance.</p>

    <p>We fall short every day. No one this side of Heaven lives a perfect day. If nothing else, we daily fail to love the Lord with all our heart, mind, and strength, or to love our neighbor as ourselves. If we are alive and breathing, then we have not yet reached perfection. We speak words we regret, allow sinful thoughts to linger, or act out of selfishness instead of love. Left unchecked, these sins harden our hearts. But when we humbly bring them before the Lord in repentance, His Spirit softens us, restores us, and draws us nearer to Himself.</p>

    <p>Repentance is not meant to weigh us down with despair but to fill us with hope. True repentance does not push us into depression—it frees us from guilt. For the believer, it is not a dreaded duty, but a joyful rhythm. It is a daily returning to the Father who welcomes us with mercy and grace. David understood this when he prayed, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10).</p>

    <p>To repent daily is to live in continual dependence on Christ’s forgiveness. It is to recognize that sin is real, but grace is greater. It is to keep short accounts with God, knowing that He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is daily repentance a rhythm in your walk with Christ?</li>
      <li>Do you see it as a burden, or as a gift of grace that restores intimacy with God?</li>
      <li>Begin today with an honest prayer of confession, trusting that His mercy is new every morning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, I confess that I often stumble and fall short of Your holiness. Forgive me for my sins, both seen and unseen. Teach me to repent daily—not just when guilt weighs heavy, but as a lifestyle of humility and dependence on You. Create in me a clean heart and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Thank You that in Christ, I find not condemnation, but mercy and grace. Amen.</p>
