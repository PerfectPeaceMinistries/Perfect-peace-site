    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.”<br>—2 Corinthians 10:5 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>Can our thoughts be sinful? Jesus answered that question clearly. In His Sermon on the Mount, He said:</p>
    <p><em>“Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”</em> (Matthew 5:28)</p>

    <p>This statement pierces deeper than actions—it exposes the inner life, where sin begins long before it ever takes outward form. The mind is not neutral ground. It is a battlefield.</p>

    <p>There is a distinction between our mind and our heart/soul, but the two are closely intertwined. What we entertain in our minds eventually takes root in our hearts. And what takes root in the heart begins to shape our character, our choices, and our worship.</p>

    <p>Thoughts shape affections, and affections shape actions.</p>

    <p>The enemy knows this. That’s why he constantly seeks to plant seeds—random sinful thoughts, anxious lies, bitter memories, or selfish fantasies. But here’s the key: Tempting thoughts are not sin—dwelling on them is.</p>

    <p>Paul tells us to “take every thought captive” and make it obedient to Christ. That means when a thought enters your mind, you don’t let it walk around unchecked. You examine it. Is this pure? Is it true? Is it honoring to God? If not—cast it away. Don’t water it. Don’t rehearse it. Don’t dress it up and call it harmless.</p>

    <p>Cast it out. And replace it.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just about lustful thoughts. This applies to every area of mental life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fearful thoughts</li>
      <li>Bitter thoughts</li>
      <li>Prideful thoughts</li>
      <li>Vengeful thoughts</li>
      <li>Hopeless thoughts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of these, if left unchecked, begin to take root. But we are not powerless. We have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16), and the Holy Spirit helps us discern what is godly and what is not.</p>

    <p>This is a daily discipline. Sometimes a minute-by-minute battle. But it’s one worth fighting—because your thought life is a reflection of your true worship.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you allow sinful or anxious thoughts to linger too long?</li>
      <li>What kinds of thoughts do you rehearse in your mind throughout the day?</li>
      <li>Are there patterns of thinking that you need to surrender to Christ?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ask Yourself:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When sinful or harmful thoughts arise, do I confront them or coddle them?</li>
      <li>Do I regularly fill my mind with Scripture to equip myself to fight?</li>
      <li>Do I believe that Christ has given me power to change even my inner thought life?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, I confess that my thoughts are not always pure or honoring to You. Teach me to recognize what is true, good, and worthy of praise. Help me to take every thought captive—to reject what is sinful and dwell on what is holy. Fill my mind with Your Word, and renew me by Your Spirit. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
