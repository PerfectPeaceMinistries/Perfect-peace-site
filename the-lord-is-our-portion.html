    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in him.” — Lamentations 3:24 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>In a world that constantly urges us to find satisfaction in possessions, achievements, or relationships, Scripture redirects our hearts to the only true source of contentment: the Lord Himself. Jeremiah, writing in the midst of grief and devastation, declares, “The LORD is my portion.” His city was in ruins, his people were suffering, yet he clung to the truth that God alone was enough.</p>

    <p>To call the Lord our “portion” is to confess that He is our inheritance, our treasure, our satisfaction. Earthly portions fade—wealth runs out, health declines, relationships change, and dreams may crumble. But God Himself never diminishes. He is infinite, faithful, and unchanging. When He is our portion, we are secure because our hope rests in who He is, not in what we have.</p>

    <p>Paul echoes this truth when he says, “I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content” (Philippians 4:11). His secret? Christ. Whether in plenty or in need, Paul’s joy did not rise and fall with circumstances but was anchored in the Lord who was his strength and portion.</p>

    <p>The world tells us that contentment comes when we get what we want. But the gospel tells us that contentment is found when we realize we already have all we need in Christ. He is our portion, our cup that never runs dry, our inheritance that cannot be taken away.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <p>Where do you most often look for satisfaction and contentment? Are you tempted to believe peace will come once you achieve a goal, gain recognition, or secure comfort? Take time today to remind your heart: the Lord Himself is your portion. In Him, you have all things.</p>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, forgive me for the times I chase after fleeting portions instead of resting in You. Teach me to be content in Your presence, to hope in Your promises, and to treasure You above all else. May my heart always say with Jeremiah, “The LORD is my portion.” In Christ’s name, Amen.</p>
