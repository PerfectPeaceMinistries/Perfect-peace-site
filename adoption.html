<h2>Adoption: Children of God</h2>
<p><strong>Key Verse:</strong><br>
“But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.” — John 1:12–13 (ESV)</p>

<h3>Definition:</h3>
<p>Adoption is the gracious act of God by which those who were once His enemies are received into His family, made His children, and granted all the rights and privileges of sonship through union with Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>While regeneration gives us new life and justification declares us righteous, adoption brings us into an intimate, familial relationship with God Himself. It is one thing to be pardoned and made right before a holy Judge; it is another to be welcomed into His household as beloved sons and daughters.</p>
<p>Adoption flows from the eternal love of God and is accomplished through Christ. It is not a natural birth “of blood” or “of the will of the flesh,” but a supernatural work of divine grace. Through faith in Christ, believers are not merely forgiven servants but dearly loved children who cry out, “Abba, Father” (Romans 8:15).</p>
<p>This new identity transforms our relationship with God completely. No longer do we stand trembling as condemned sinners; we approach Him as children secure in His affection. We are lifted from the mire of sin and given the keys to the Kingdom. Our inheritance is not earthly wealth but the eternal riches of glory in Christ. As Paul declares, “If children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17). Through adoption, we are destined to reign with Him.</p>
<p>Adoption also reshapes how we view others within the body of Christ. Every believer is a brother or sister, sharing the same Spirit and the same Father. The household of faith is our eternal family, bound together by grace.</p>

<h3>Application:</h3>
<p>Adoption invites us to rest in the unshakable security of God’s fatherly love. We are His children. When doubt or fear arises, we find comfort in the truth that we belong to our Father forever. This reality frees us from striving for approval and empowers us to live in joyful obedience.</p>
<p>Yet we must never forget that our adoption came at great cost—the death of the Son, that we might become sons and daughters. Our privilege was purchased by His blood. Therefore, let our response be one of gratitude, humility, and loving devotion toward our Father.</p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p>To be adopted by God is to belong eternally. It is to have a Father who will never abandon, disown, or forsake you. Every act of discipline is love. Every blessing is care. Every trial is preparation for glory. Do you live each day as one who knows you are dearly loved by your heavenly Father?</p>

<h3>Prayer:</h3>
<p>Father in Heaven, thank You for welcoming me into Your family through Christ. I was once Your enemy, but You have made me Your child. Teach me to rest in Your love and to reflect that love toward others who share in this adoption. Let my life bear witness to the grace that made me Yours. Amen.</p>
