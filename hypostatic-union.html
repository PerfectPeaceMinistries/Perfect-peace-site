      <h2>The Hypostatic Union</h2>

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us…” — John 1:14 (ESV)<br>
        “For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.” — Colossians 2:9 (ESV)<br>
        “Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus… being born in the likeness of men.” — Philippians 2:5–7 (ESV)
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p><strong>ὑπόστασις (hypostasis)</strong> — “substance,” “person,” “the essence or reality of being.”</p>
      <p>The hypostatic union describes the mysterious and glorious union of both the divine and human natures in the one Person of Jesus Christ. Jesus is truly God and truly man — without mixture, confusion, separation, or division.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>The eternal Son of God did not merely appear as a man, nor did He become a hybrid being. Rather, His eternal divine nature took on a true human nature — body, soul, mind, will, and emotions — without ever ceasing to be fully God.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Christ is one Person</strong> — not two persons or a divided identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Christ has two full natures</strong> — divine and human.</li>
        <li><strong>The natures do not blend</strong> — His divinity is never diluted, nor His humanity absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>The natures cannot be separated</strong> — from the Incarnation onward, He remains the God-Man forever.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Because of this perfect union, Jesus can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live a perfectly sinless human life.</li>
        <li>Represent humanity as the second Adam.</li>
        <li>Offer Himself as a spotless sacrifice.</li>
        <li>Sympathize with our weaknesses while possessing the power to save completely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The hypostatic union safeguards the truth that Jesus is the perfect Mediator — fully able to stand before God for us, and fully able to stand before us as God.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jesus understands you.</strong> He experienced hunger, fatigue, sorrow, temptation, and grief — yet without sin.</li>
        <li><strong>Jesus intercedes for you.</strong> As the spotless God-Man, He forever imputes His righteousness to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Jesus is near to you.</strong> His humanity draws Him close; His divinity ensures He is mighty to save.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Do I rest in the fact that Jesus knows what it is to be human?<br>
      Do I trust Him as both sympathetic High Priest and almighty Lord?<br>
      How does His two-natured Person deepen my worship and obedience?</p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Father, thank You for sending Your Son — truly God and truly man — to dwell among us. Help me rest in the truth that Christ knows my weaknesses and yet reigns with all authority. Increase my faith in His power, deepen my awe of His humility, and draw my heart to worship Him more fully. Amen.</p>
