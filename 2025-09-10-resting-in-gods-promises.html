      <h3 class="section-title">Key Verse</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.” — Isaiah 26:3 (ESV)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="section-title">Devotion</h3>
      <p>Life often feels uncertain. Our jobs, finances, health, and relationships can shift in an instant, leaving us anxious about tomorrow. Yet in the middle of this fragile world, God’s Word stands unshakable. His promises are not vague hopes—they are firm anchors for weary souls.</p><p>Resting on God’s promises means choosing to let His Word carry the weight of our fears. When He says, “I will never leave you nor forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5), we can trust that no circumstance will remove His presence. When He declares, “My grace is sufficient for you” (2 Corinthians 12:9), we can lean on Him even when weakness feels overwhelming. And when He tells us that He will finish the good work He began in us (Philippians 1:6), we know we will endure, prevail, and one day be glorified with Christ. His promises are not empty—they are blood-bought guarantees, sealed by Christ Himself.</p><p>True rest is not found in the absence of trouble, but in God’s peace amid the trouble. The storms may rage, but the One who calmed the sea calls us to trust Him. As we meditate on His promises, our restless hearts find peace, and our anxious minds grow quiet.</p><p>Let us not merely read His promises but live by them—reminding ourselves daily that our Father is faithful to every word He has spoken.</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Reflection Questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Which promise of God do you need to hold onto most today?</li><li>How can you remind yourself daily that His Word is more certain than your circumstances?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">Closing Prayer</h3>
      <p>Father, thank You that Your promises are sure and steady when life feels fragile. Teach me to rest in Your Word and to trust that You are faithful. Quiet my anxious heart, and keep my mind stayed on You. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
