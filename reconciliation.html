      <h2>Reconciliation</h2>

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.”<br>
        — Romans 5:10 (ESV)
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself…”<br>
        — 2 Corinthians 5:18 (ESV)
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things…”<br>
        — Colossians 1:19–20 (ESV)
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>The Greek word translated <em>“reconcile”</em> is καταλλάσσω (<em>katallassō</em>), meaning to change, exchange hostility for peace, or restore a relationship that was once broken. In the New Testament, reconciliation refers to the act by which God removes the enmity between Himself and sinners, restoring them to peaceful fellowship through the work of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Reconciliation does not mean that God softened His holiness or overlooked sin. Rather, it means that through Christ, the barrier that separated us from God was fully and justly removed.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>Sin did not merely make humanity morally weak or spiritually sick—it made us enemies of God. Scripture is unflinching in its diagnosis. Because of sin, mankind stood in active opposition to God’s holiness, alienated from His presence, and under His righteous judgment (Romans 8:7; Colossians 1:21).</p>
      <p>This separation was stark and unbridgeable by man. God was not distant because He was unwilling to draw near, but because His holiness cannot dwell with sin. The relationship was broken, the fellowship severed, and the hostility real.</p>
      <p>Yet Romans 5:10 reveals the staggering grace of the gospel: while we were enemies, God acted. As Ephesians 2 declares in verse 4, “But God…”—not man—initiated reconciliation. It did not begin with human will, repentance, or moral improvement, but with divine initiative. God reconciled us to Himself by the death of His Son.</p>
      <p>Here the doctrine of reconciliation flows directly from mediation. Christ stands between God and man—not as a neutral third party, but as the God-appointed Mediator who bears the full cost of peace. By absorbing sin’s penalty in His death, Jesus removed the cause of hostility. Justice was satisfied, and the relationship restored.</p>
      <p>Reconciliation, then, is the relational outcome of Christ’s mediating work. Where there was once enmity, there is now peace. Where there was separation, there is now communion.</p>

      <h3>What Reconciliation Accomplishes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Hostility Is Removed</strong> — God’s wrath is no longer directed toward those who are in Christ (Romans 8:1).</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship Is Restored</strong> — Believers are welcomed into fellowship with God as friends rather than enemies (John 15:15).</li>
        <li><strong>Peace with God Is Established</strong> — An objective peace secured by the finished work of Christ (Romans 5:1).</li>
        <li><strong>A Ministry of Reconciliation Is Entrusted</strong> — Reconciled believers are called to proclaim this message to the world (2 Corinthians 5:19–20).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>The doctrine of reconciliation reshapes how we understand both God and ourselves. We no longer approach God as enemies hoping for tolerance, but as children welcomed by grace. In a divided world, Christ shows us that God restores what sin has broken.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Consider what it means that you were once an enemy of God and are now at peace with Him. Where do you still live as though the relationship is fragile or uncertain? What would it look like to rest fully in the truth that reconciliation has already been accomplished?</p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Gracious Father, thank You for reconciling me to Yourself through the death of Your Son. When I was Your enemy, You made peace. Teach me to live in the confidence of restored fellowship, to rest in the finished work of Christ, and to reflect Your reconciling grace to others. Amen.</p>
