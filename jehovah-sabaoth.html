    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory!”<br>— Psalm 24:10 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>The name <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em> is one of the most majestic and awe-inspiring titles of God in all of Scripture. It means “The LORD of Hosts” — the Commander of the armies of heaven. This name reveals God's absolute sovereignty, His supreme authority, and His unmatched power to lead, defend, and wage war on behalf of His people.</p>

    <p>The word “hosts” (Hebrew: <em>tsaba</em>) refers to vast angelic armies — heavenly forces under God's command. It includes the armies of angels, the stars and planets, and even the earthly armies that God sovereignly directs. When we call Him <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em>, we are acknowledging that all the forces in heaven and on earth are subject to His authority.</p>

    <p>This name is used nearly 250 times in Scripture, often during times of national crisis, spiritual decline, or battle. It is a name invoked when God’s people need reminding that they are not alone — that the God who commands angels stands with them and fights for them.</p>

    <p>One of the most memorable moments this name appears is in the story of <strong>David and Goliath</strong>. A young shepherd boy, armed with nothing but a sling and faith, stood before a towering warrior and declared:</p>

    <p><em>“You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts…”</em> (1 Samuel 17:45)</p>

    <p>David knew that <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em> was with him. He wasn’t alone in battle. The LORD of angel armies stood behind him, and that gave him courage.</p>

    <p>The prophet Isaiah also called on <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em> in a time of great fear and uncertainty. Surrounded by enemies, he saw the Lord “high and lifted up” (Isaiah 6:1) — a vision that reminded him of God's supremacy over all the earth. The angels cried out:</p>

    <p><em>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!”</em> (Isaiah 6:3)</p>

    <p>Even in the New Testament, Mary, the mother of Jesus, references this title in her song (Luke 1:46–55), rejoicing that the mighty One had shown strength with His arm. <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em> is not just a name of fearsome power — it is also a name of hope for the weak, comfort for the oppressed, and strength for the weary.</p>

    <p>When we are overwhelmed, when the odds are against us, when evil seems to prevail — <em>Jehovah Sabaoth</em> reminds us that God is our divine Warrior. He fights for His people. He commands angels. He never loses.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I trust that God is fighting for me, even when I don’t see it?</li>
      <li>When I face spiritual warfare or fear, do I call upon Jehovah Sabaoth?</li>
      <li>Am I relying on my own strength, or resting in the power of the One who commands angelic armies?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Scriptures:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.” — Psalm 46:7</li>
      <li>“Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him… that He may deliver their soul from death.” — Psalm 33:18–19</li>
      <li>“You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.” — Deuteronomy 3:22</li>
      <li>“The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them.” — Psalm 68:17</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>LORD of Hosts, Jehovah Sabaoth, You are mighty in battle and faithful to deliver. When I feel surrounded by darkness, help me remember that You command angel armies. Let me walk in courage, not fear — trusting that You go before me and stand behind me. Teach me to rest in Your strength, not my own. You are my defender, my refuge, and my King. I worship You. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
