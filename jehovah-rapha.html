    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #e9f8f3; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #94bfa3;">
      “I am the Lord, your healer.”<br>
      — Exodus 15:26 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>
      The name <strong>Jehovah Rapha</strong> comes from the Hebrew word <em>rapha</em>, meaning "to heal, restore, or make whole." In Exodus 15:26, God reveals Himself to the Israelites as “the Lord, your healer,” right after He turned bitter water into drinkable water at Marah. This name is a promise of His nature—not only as one who heals physical ailments, but one who restores every dimension of our brokenness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jehovah Rapha heals our <strong>bodies</strong> (“He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” — Psalm 147:3), our <strong>souls</strong> (“Bless the Lord… who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases.” — Psalm 103:2–3), and even our <strong>nations</strong> (“I will heal their land.” — 2 Chronicles 7:14). His healing touches hearts, memories, trauma, and sin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, Jehovah Rapha is most fully revealed in Jesus Christ. Through His ministry on earth, Jesus healed the sick, opened blind eyes, and raised the dead. But all of this pointed to the deeper spiritual healing offered through the cross. As Isaiah 53:5 declares, “By His wounds we are healed.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Healing may come in stages—sometimes physical, sometimes spiritual, sometimes eternal—but it always comes according to His wisdom and timing. Whether God heals today or in the resurrection to come, He is still Jehovah Rapha. His heart is always toward restoration.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What wounds—physical, emotional, or spiritual—do you need to bring to Jehovah Rapha?</li>
      <li>How do Jesus’ miracles confirm God’s healing nature?</li>
      <li>Can you trust God even when healing doesn’t happen right away?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>
      Jehovah Rapha, You are the Lord who heals. I bring to You my broken places—my hurts, my fears, my sin. Touch me with Your grace. Heal my wounds, restore my soul, and make me whole in Christ. Help me to trust Your timing and cling to Your promises. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
