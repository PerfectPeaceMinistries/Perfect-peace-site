    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain.”<br>— Hebrews 6:19 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>In a world of shifting values, crumbling foundations, and unexpected storms, many are searching for stability—something unshakable. Scripture tells us that such a foundation exists, and it is found not in circumstances, success, or self, but in Christ alone.</p>

    <p>Hebrews 6:19 describes hope in Christ as “a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul.” This is not a vague optimism that things might get better. It is a living hope, rooted in the unchanging promises of God and secured by the finished work of Jesus. This hope holds us fast when the winds of doubt blow and the waters of suffering rise.</p>

    <p>This anchor does not rest in shallow water. It enters “into the inner place behind the curtain”—the very presence of God. Our hope is anchored in heaven, where Christ has gone before us as our High Priest. He intercedes for us. He secures us. He keeps us from drifting away.</p>

    <p>When your soul feels restless, when fears surround you, remember this: you are anchored. The rope is tied to Christ. He will not let you go.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is my hope grounded in Christ or in changing circumstances?</li>
      <li>How does the image of an anchor help me understand the security of God’s promises?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, when storms come and the world shakes, remind me that my soul is anchored in You. Strengthen my heart with the hope of heaven. Help me trust Your promises when I cannot see the way. Keep me steady and steadfast until the day I see You face to face. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
