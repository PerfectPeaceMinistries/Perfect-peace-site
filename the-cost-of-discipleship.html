    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.”<br>— Luke 9:23 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>Following Jesus is not a casual decision. It is a call to die.</p>

    <p>In Luke 9:23, Jesus sets the terms of discipleship clearly: deny yourself, take up your cross daily, and follow Him. These are not poetic words or religious suggestions. They are commands. They are a death sentence to self-centered living.</p>

    <p>To follow Christ is to lay down your goals, dreams, and personal ambitions at the foot of the cross and to say, “Not my will, but Yours be done.” This is not an easy path. It means trading the pursuit of comfort, status, and self-fulfillment for a life of obedience, humility, and service. It’s no longer about what we want—it’s about what He wants.</p>

    <p>Paul describes this life vividly in Galatians 2:20:<br><em>“I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.”</em></p>

    <p>True Christianity isn’t about adding Jesus to our plans. It’s about dying to our plans so that Christ becomes our life.</p>

    <p>This kind of self-denial overflows into how we treat others. Philippians 2:3–4 tells us:<br><em>“Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”</em></p>

    <p>The Christian life is radically others-focused. As Christ served, so we serve. As Christ laid down His life, so we lay down ours—not always in death, but in daily, living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). This includes sacrificing time, energy, convenience, and resources for the sake of others. It means letting go of the idol of self.</p>

    <p>We are not here to build our personal kingdoms. We are here to advance His.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have I truly surrendered my dreams and desires to Christ?</li>
      <li>Am I counting others as more significant than myself?</li>
      <li>How does my daily life reflect self-denial and service?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, You gave everything for me. You laid down Your life so that I might live. Help me to lay down my life in return—not just in words, but in action. Teach me to deny myself, to take up my cross daily, and to follow You with all that I am. Break the grip of selfishness in my heart. Teach me to love others more than myself. Use my life to serve Your kingdom, not my own. I want to live for You alone. Amen.</p>
