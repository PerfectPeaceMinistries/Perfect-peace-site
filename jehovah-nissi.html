    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The Lord is my banner.” —Exodus 17:15 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>The name <strong>Jehovah Nissi</strong> appears only once in Scripture—Exodus 17:15—but its meaning echoes throughout the biblical narrative. “The Lord is my banner” speaks of God as the One who goes before His people in battle, the One under whom they march, and the One who ultimately secures the victory. In the ancient world, a banner was more than decoration—it was a rallying point, a declaration of identity, and a symbol of triumph.</p>

    <p>The context of this name is found in the wilderness, where the Israelites had just defeated the Amalekites. Moses, standing on a hill with the staff of God raised high, watched as Israel prevailed while his hands were lifted. When his arms grew weary, Aaron and Hur supported him. Victory was secured not by Israel’s strength, but by the power of God working through obedience, prayer, and faith.</p>

    <p>After the battle, Moses built an altar and called it <strong>Jehovah Nissi</strong>, proclaiming that it was <em>the Lord</em> who had fought for them. The uplifted staff symbolized divine intervention and authority—it was God who led, God who gave strength, and God who delivered. The banner was not a flag or a slogan, but a Person: <em>The Lord Himself.</em></p>

    <p>For the believer, this is deeply comforting. When we face trials, temptations, or spiritual warfare, we are not left to fight in our own strength. We rally under the banner of the Lord. We belong to Him, are led by Him, and are protected by Him. Just as an army marches under a banner that declares its allegiance, so we live under the rule and name of our God—Jehovah Nissi.</p>

    <p>Jesus, too, is our banner. He is the One lifted high—not just on the cross, but in glory. We follow Him. He is the rallying point for all who trust in Him, the standard raised for the nations (Isaiah 11:10). He fights our battles and calls us to rest in His victory.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Jehovah Nissi reminds us that <strong>God is our identity and victory</strong>.</li>
      <li>Our battles are not ours alone—<strong>He fights for us</strong> (Exodus 14:14).</li>
      <li>We are to <strong>lift high the name of the Lord</strong>, not just in song, but in our lives (Psalm 60:4).</li>
      <li>Jesus is the fulfillment of this name—<strong>our banner of salvation</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Scriptures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exodus 17:8–16</strong> – The battle against Amalek and the naming of Jehovah Nissi</li>
      <li><strong>Psalm 20:5</strong> – “May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners!”</li>
      <li><strong>Isaiah 11:10,12</strong> – The Messiah as the signal/banner for the peoples</li>
      <li><strong>John 12:32</strong> – “And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Whose banner are you marching under? Is your identity wrapped up in yourself, your plans, your strength—or is it rooted in the Lord? The Christian life is not a solo mission. We follow our King into battle, trusting that His banner over us is love, victory, and faithfulness. Lift His name high, and let it be clear to the world whom you serve.</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Jehovah Nissi, my Banner—thank You for going before me, fighting for me, and covering me with Your strength and mercy. In every battle I face, remind me that I march under Your name, not my own. Let my life proclaim You as Lord, and may I never forget that the victory belongs to You alone. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
