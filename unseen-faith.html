  <section>
    <p>Though we have not seen Christ with our eyes, we love Him, and through faith, we rejoice with a joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory (1 Peter 1:8). As Hebrews reminds us, “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1). Our hope is not based on what we can touch or prove, but on the unshakable promises of God. Jesus Himself prayed for us when He said, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (John 20:29), and in His high priestly prayer He declared, “I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word” (John 17:20). We are those believers—born of faith, anchored in hope, and filled with joy.</p>
