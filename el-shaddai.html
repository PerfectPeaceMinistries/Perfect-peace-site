    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #e9f8f3; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #94bfa3;">
      “When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, ‘I am El Shaddai. Walk before me, and be blameless.’”  
      <br>— Genesis 17:1 (adapted from the Hebrew)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>
      The name <strong>El Shaddai</strong> is one of the most awe-inspiring titles used for God in all of Scripture. It first appears in Genesis 17:1 when God comes to an aging Abram and says, “I am El Shaddai”—often translated as “God Almighty.” In that moment, God reaffirms His covenant and promises to make Abram the father of many nations. The situation seems impossible. But that is exactly where the might of El Shaddai is revealed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hebrew word <em>El</em> simply means “God.” The second part, <em>Shaddai</em>, is debated. Some scholars connect it to the root <em>shadad</em>, meaning “to overpower” or “to destroy,” which emphasizes God’s unstoppable power—hence, “God Almighty.” Others trace it to <em>shad</em>, meaning “breast,” which paints a picture of sustenance and nurture—“The All-Sufficient One.” Both are biblically supported, and together they give us a more complete understanding: El Shaddai is both powerful and tender. He is the One who can do all things, and the One who provides all we need.
    </p>

    <p>
      El Shaddai appears in moments of great need and divine assurance. Isaac blesses Jacob by this name (Genesis 28:3). Jacob calls on El Shaddai for mercy over his sons (Genesis 43:14). In the book of Job, Shaddai is used more than 30 times—highlighting God's sovereign control over suffering and restoration.
    </p>

    <p>
      To know God as El Shaddai is to rest in the truth that we are not self-sufficient, but He is. When we reach the end of our strength, our plans, our understanding—He is more than enough. He is able to do what no human effort can accomplish. His power is limitless. His provision is complete. He is not merely strong; He is sufficient.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is mighty enough to command galaxies—and gentle enough to comfort the brokenhearted. This is the God we serve.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In what areas of life do I need to surrender control and trust El Shaddai?</li>
      <li>Am I leaning on my own sufficiency or God's?</li>
      <li>How has God shown Himself mighty and tender in my life?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>
      El Shaddai, my Almighty God and All-Sufficient One—You are everything I need. When I am weak, You are strong. When I am empty, You sustain me. Help me to trust in Your might and rest in Your sufficiency. Teach me to walk blameless before You, not in my own strength, but by faith in Your power. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
    </p>
