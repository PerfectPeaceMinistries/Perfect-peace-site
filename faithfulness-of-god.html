    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.”<br>— Psalm 119:90 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>Life changes. Seasons shift. People come and go. Plans fail. Our emotions fluctuate. But one thing remains constant: <strong>God is faithful.</strong> He is immutable—unchanging—steadfast through all generations. His promises are a sure foundation we can count on. He never fails us.</p><p>His Word is not bound by time or weakened by circumstance. The same God who parted the Red Sea, who fed Elijah by a brook, who raised Lazarus from the tomb—is the same God who holds you in His hand today.</p><p><strong>One of my personal favorite promises is found in Philippians 1:6:</strong><br><em>“And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”</em> — Philippians 1:6 (ESV)</p><p>This verse brings me great comfort. I know with full assurance that God will finish the work He began in me. He won’t let me fall away. In Christ, I will overcome. I will endure. I will prevail.</p><p>In joyful seasons, we see His faithfulness in provision and blessing. In painful seasons, we cling to His promises even when we can’t see the outcome. In the waiting, we trust that He has not forgotten us. His timing is perfect. His purposes are sure. He does not change with the winds of emotion or the trials of this world.</p><p>When you feel weary, remind your heart that <em>He who calls you is faithful</em>. When your prayers seem unanswered, remember—His delays are not His denials. He is always working—always keeping His covenant of love.</p><p>The world will try to shake your foundation. But if you are rooted in the truth that God is always faithful, <strong>you will not be moved</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In what ways have you seen God’s faithfulness in past seasons of your life?</li><li>What promises of God can you cling to in your current season?</li><li>How might your trust in His faithfulness encourage someone else this week?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Faithful Father, thank You that You never change. When my world shifts and my heart feels uncertain, You remain my rock. Help me to remember Your goodness in every season—when it’s easy and when it’s not. Strengthen my trust, deepen my roots, and use my life to proclaim that You are always faithful. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
