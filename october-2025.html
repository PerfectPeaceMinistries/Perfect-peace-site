  <h2><a href="faith-over-fear.html">Faith Over Fear</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 7, 2025</div>
  <p>Fear is one of the enemy’s favorite weapons. It whispers lies that cause us to doubt God’s goodness, question His promises, and shrink back from the calling He has placed on our lives. Yet Scripture reminds us that fear does not come from God...</p>

  <h2><a href="when-god-allows-what-we-dont-understand.html">When God Allows What We Don’t Understand</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 8, 2025</div>
  <p>Even when our minds falter and life feels uncertain, God remains sovereign. Every trial, even the ones we don’t understand, is ordained for our sanctification and His glory...</p>

  <h2><a href="contentment-in-christ-not-circumstance.html">Contentment in Christ, Not Circumstance</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 9, 2025</div>
  <p>True contentment is not found in ease or comfort but in Christ Himself. Paul learned to be content in all circumstances, not because life was easy, but because his strength came from Jesus...</p>

  <div class="post-item">
  <h2><a href="abundant-life-in-christ.html">Abundant Life in Christ</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 10, 2025</div>
  <p>Jesus came not merely to give us existence, but abundant life—one filled with His presence, peace, and purpose. This life isn’t about possessions or comfort, but about knowing Him deeply and walking daily in His fullness...</p>

  <h2><a href="the-lord-of-the-harvest.html">The Lord of the Harvest</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 11, 2025</div>
  <p>During a joyful day at the pumpkin patch, surrounded by laughter and fields bursting with pumpkins, we’re reminded that God is the Lord of the harvest — the One who gives both physical and spiritual growth. Every blessing, from family to faith, is a gift sustained by His hand...</p>

  <h2><a href="rest-for-the-mind.html">Rest for the Mind</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 12, 2025</div>
  <p>The Bible doesn’t shy away from showing us moments of emotional strain and mental weariness — even among God’s most faithful servants. Scripture makes it clear that caring for our minds and hearts is part of walking closely with Him...</p>

  <h2><a href="the-light-that-never-fades.html">The Light That Never Fades</a></h2>
  <div class="date">October 13, 2025</div>
  <p>Even though we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light, a temporal darkness can still settle over us quietly. Yet in that very darkness, Jesus speaks a word of promise: “I am the light of the world.”...</p>
