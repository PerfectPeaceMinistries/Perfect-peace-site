    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.”<br>— Galatians 5:16 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>We know we are called to pursue righteousness. We know the seriousness of sin—how offensive it is to God, how destructive it is to our souls. And yet, so often, we find ourselves battling against its pull. So the question becomes: how do we fight sin practically?</p>

    <p>We’ve previously discussed taking every thought captive and making it obedient to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). That remains a foundational truth—because sin begins in the mind. Before there is an action, there is a thought. And if we do not reject that thought or submit it to Christ, it grows roots in our heart and eventually bears the fruit of sin.</p>

    <p>But in the day-to-day struggle, how do we actually combat it?</p>

    <p>First and foremost, you must understand this: the battle belongs to the Lord. If you’re dealing with a sin that feels relentless—something you just can’t seem to shake—take heart. Victory is not ultimately yours to achieve, but God’s to give. He is the one who fights for you, the one who delivers, and that deliverance will come in His perfect timing. Until then, our responsibility is obedience. Our call is to walk in the Spirit.</p>

    <p>What does it mean to “walk in the Spirit”? It means staying spiritually engaged—immersed in the things of God. It means cultivating spiritual disciplines that nourish the soul and strengthen your resistance to sin. We fight sin not only by resisting the wrong things, but by filling our lives with the right things.</p>

    <p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reading Scripture regularly</strong> – God’s Word renews our minds and gives us discernment.</li>
      <li><strong>Praying continually</strong> – We confess, we ask for help, we stay near to our source of strength.</li>
      <li><strong>Worshiping faithfully</strong> – Both in private, in family, and with the body of Christ.</li>
      <li><strong>Serving others</strong> – Love for neighbor redirects our focus off of self.</li>
      <li><strong>Fellowshipping with believers</strong> – Community sharpens us, encourages us, and holds us accountable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The more time you spend doing spiritual things, the less opportunity there is for sin to gain a foothold. Light and darkness cannot occupy the same space. A heart filled with the Spirit has little room for the flesh.</p>

    <p>So take heart. The fact that you are in the fight is a sign of life. The Spirit is at work in you. Keep your eyes on Christ. Be diligent in the disciplines. And rest in this: your victory over sin is already secured in the finished work of Jesus.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What specific spiritual disciplines have you neglected lately?</li>
      <li>Are there areas in your life where you’re trying to fight sin alone instead of relying on the Spirit?</li>
      <li>How can you make more space in your day for spiritual things?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, we confess that apart from You, we can do nothing. We are weak, but You are strong. Teach us to walk in the Spirit and to delight in Your ways. Guard our hearts from sin. Renew our minds daily. Help us to hunger for holiness, and when we stumble, draw us quickly back to You. Thank You for the victory You have already won on our behalf. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
