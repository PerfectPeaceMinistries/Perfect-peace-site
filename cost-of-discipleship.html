    <h1>The Cost of Discipleship</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <blockquote>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.” — Luke 9:23</blockquote>

    <p>Jesus never softened the call to follow Him. He never begged for converts. He never offered a gospel of convenience or comfort. Instead, He warned His would-be disciples to count the cost. To follow Christ is to die to self. It is to surrender all that you are—all that you have—all that you hope to be. It is not a one-time decision but a lifelong calling. Many are willing to admire Jesus. Few are willing to follow Him to the cross.</p>

    <p>When Jesus says, “Deny yourself,” He’s not simply calling for a reduction of pleasures or a few moral adjustments. He’s calling for the dethroning of self. To deny yourself is to lay down your rights, your desires, and your plans. It is to say, “Not my will, but Yours be done.” The Christian life is not about adding Jesus to your schedule—it’s about surrendering everything under His lordship. Paul said it plainly: “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.” (Galatians 2:20)</p>

    <p>Taking up your cross is not just about enduring difficulties. It is about identifying with Christ in His suffering and shame. In the first century, the cross was a symbol of public humiliation and death. To “take up your cross” meant to be marked for death. It was a call to absolute surrender, knowing that obedience might cost you your reputation, your relationships, your freedom—or even your life. And Jesus says we must do this daily. Discipleship isn’t a single moment of courage; it’s a daily death to comfort, sin, pride, and the desire to be accepted by the world.</p>

    <p>Jesus goes even further: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.” (Luke 9:24) This is the great paradox of the Christian life. In trying to preserve our own comfort, control, and security, we forfeit eternal joy. But in laying it all down at the feet of Christ, we find life that cannot be taken away. Every ambition we release, every possession we surrender, every comfort we sacrifice—it all pales in comparison to what we gain in Him.</p>

    <p>Jesus told His followers to count the cost. He used the image of a man building a tower or a king going to war (Luke 14:28–33). He didn’t want emotional decisions made in haste. He wanted hearts surrendered in full. The path of discipleship is narrow and hard, and it must be walked with open eyes. True converts follow Christ on His terms, not their own.</p>

    <p>But make no mistake: though the cost is high, the reward is infinitely greater. In losing the world, we gain Christ. In dying to self, we rise to life. Jesus is the treasure hidden in the field, the pearl of great price. What we leave behind is nothing compared to what we receive. If we suffer with Him, we will also reign with Him. The cross leads to the crown. The crucified life leads to resurrection glory.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Are you following Jesus on His terms—or on your own? What areas of your life have you been unwilling to surrender? Have you truly counted the cost?</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Lord, teach me what it means to follow You with a surrendered heart. Help me to count the cost honestly, and to love You more than anything this world offers. May I take up my cross daily and find true life in You alone. Strengthen me to follow—even when it costs everything. Amen.</p>
