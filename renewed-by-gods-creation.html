    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.” — Psalm 19:1 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“And he said, ‘My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.’” — Exodus 33:14 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>I’m on vacation this week, spending time with my family at the beach. Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina is one of my favorite places on earth. The small-town feel, with its local shops, stores, and restaurants, creates a slow-paced and relaxing atmosphere—a welcome change from the usual rhythm of life. Vacations give us the gift of slowing down and stepping away. When we step outside, breathe in the fresh air, and take in the beauty of God’s handiwork—the mountains, the sea, the forests, or even a quiet sunrise—we are reminded that creation itself points us back to the Creator. The heavens are not silent; they proclaim His glory day after day.</p>

    <p>Christ Himself modeled this rhythm of rest. The Gospels tell us that Jesus often withdrew to desolate places to pray (Luke 5:16), and He urged His disciples, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while” (Mark 6:31). Rest is not wasted time—it is an act of trust. When we step away, we acknowledge that God is sovereign and that we are not sustained by constant activity, but by Him alone.</p>

    <p>Being in nature allows us to see more clearly: the God who paints the skies, who waters the earth, and who sustains the smallest sparrow is the same God who sustains us. As you rest and take in His creation, remember that true peace is not found in the scenery itself, but in the Lord who made it. He is both the Giver of rest and the source of renewal for weary souls.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <p>Take a moment today—whether by the ocean, the mountains, or under the open sky—to pause in stillness. Let creation’s beauty lift your heart to worship. Ask yourself: Do I trust God enough to truly rest in Him?</p>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for the gift of creation that reminds me of Your power and beauty. Teach me to find my rest not only in quiet places, but in Christ Himself. As I take in the sights and sounds of Your world, may my heart be renewed, my burdens lightened, and my soul refreshed in You. Amen.</p>
