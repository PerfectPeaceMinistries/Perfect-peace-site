    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”<br>— Galatians 5:13 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>Christian freedom is not a license to do as we please—it is the liberty to live as we were meant to. When Christ sets us free, He delivers us not just from sin’s penalty, but from self’s dominion. And what do we do with this freedom? Paul says, “Through love serve one another.”</p>

    <p>In the kingdom of God, greatness is measured by servanthood. Jesus, though fully God, “did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,” but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant (Philippians 2:6–7). He washed feet. He fed the hungry. He laid down His life. He said, “I am among you as the one who serves” (Luke 22:27). To follow Him is to follow in that humility.</p>

    <p>Serving one another is not about waiting until you feel gifted or inspired—it’s about love. It’s not rooted in convenience or comfort but in sacrifice. We serve because Christ first served us. We give because He gave. We love because He loved.</p>

    <p>Every believer has been given gifts by the Holy Spirit—not to hoard or elevate ourselves, but to build up the body of Christ (1 Peter 4:10). Whether you teach, encourage, cook, clean, counsel, listen, give, visit, or pray—every act of service matters. And when it’s done in love, it glorifies God.</p>

    <p>This kind of community is what sets the church apart. It’s not a gathering of consumers, but a family of givers. A body, where each part contributes to the health of the whole. A people eager to outdo one another in showing honor (Romans 12:10).</p>

    <p>Serving one another in love isn’t flashy—but it is holy. It’s not always noticed by man—but it’s seen by God. And in every small act of love, the heart of Christ is made visible to the world.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where are you currently serving others—and is it motivated by love?</li>
      <li>Are there needs in your church, family, or community that you’ve been ignoring or delaying to meet?</li>
      <li>How can you be more intentional in using your spiritual gifts to build others up?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, You came not to be served but to serve. Forgive me when I chase comfort, recognition, or selfish gain. Fill me with Your Spirit, that I may serve with joy, humility, and love. Open my eyes to the needs around me. Teach me to wash feet, bear burdens, and lay down my rights for the good of others. May my life reflect the servant heart of Christ. In His holy name I pray, Amen.</p>
