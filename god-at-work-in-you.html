    <p><strong>Sanctification</strong> begins at conversion and continues until glorification. It is a lifelong process marked by trials and tribulations, challenges, struggles, and temptations. Paul calls us to “work out” our salvation—not to <em>work for</em> it, but to live it out with reverence, knowing it is God Himself who energizes and shapes our obedience as we grow in holiness.</p>

    <p>This passage holds together two powerful truths: our responsibility and God’s sovereignty. We are called to pursue holiness, to actively obey, and to take our walk seriously. Yet beneath all our effort is a divine power at work—God is the one producing both the desire and the strength to do what pleases Him.</p>

    <p>This is not a call to anxiety, but to awe. Not a burden, but an invitation to participate in the transforming work of the Spirit.</p>

    <p>So walk faithfully, humbly, and confidently—knowing that God is at work in you, conforming you to Christ, and that He will complete the good work He began in you.</p>
