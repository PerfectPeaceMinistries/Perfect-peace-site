    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “In the beginning, <em>God</em> (<em>Elohim</em>) created the heavens and the earth.” — Genesis 1:1 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p><strong>Elohim</strong> (אֱלֹהִים) is the first name the Bible gives to God. Though plural in form, it joins singular verbs, a grammatical marker that magnifies both His unity and His majesty. The shorter root <em>El</em> means “mighty one”; together they proclaim the <em>Creator</em> who spoke the universe into being.</p>

    <p>Genesis 1 unfurls His creative power: light, sky, land, seas, stars, creatures, and humankind come forth at His command. Creation is no accident—every atom answers to Elohim.</p>

    <p>Because life cannot arise from non-life, naturalistic explanations of spontaneous origin (abiogenesis) stumble where Scripture stands firm: “in Him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). As houses imply builders, so the cosmos announces a Designer.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Psalm 19:1–4</strong> — The heavens declare His glory.</li>
      <li><strong>Romans 1:19–20</strong> — Creation makes His power plain.</li>
      <li><strong>Hebrews 3:4</strong> — Every house has a builder; God built all things.</li>
      <li><strong>Colossians 1:16</strong> — All things were made through and for Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Acknowledging Elohim as Creator reframes life: we are stewards, not owners; purposeful, not accidental.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Where do you most clearly sense God’s creative hand?</li>
      <li>How does recognizing God as Creator shape your stewardship of His world?</li>
      <li>What areas have you wrongly chalked up to chance rather than providence?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p><em>Sovereign Elohim, Maker of heaven and earth, thank You for the beauty, order, and purpose You have woven into creation. Open my eyes to Your fingerprints in every sunrise and every heartbeat. Strengthen my faith when the world preaches chance, and teach me to honor You as Creator in thought, word, and deed. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
