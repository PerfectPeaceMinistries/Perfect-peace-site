  <h2><a href="#">Growing in Godliness – The Role of Spiritual Disciplines</a></h2>
  <div class="date">June 13, 2025</div>
  <p><strong>“Train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way.”</strong><br>
  —1 Timothy 4:7b–8a</p>

  <h3>Prayer – Communing with God</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Prayer is our lifeline to God. It expresses dependence, adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.” —Colossians 4:2</li>
    <li>“Pray without ceasing.” —1 Thessalonians 5:17</li>
    <li>“The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.” —James 5:16b</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bible Study – Hearing from God</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Scripture is the primary way we hear from God. It renews our minds and helps us grow in wisdom and righteousness.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” —2 Timothy 3:16</li>
    <li>“Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.” —1 Peter 2:2</li>
    <li>“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” —Psalm 119:105</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Church Fellowship – Living in Community</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> God calls us into a spiritual family where we grow through encouragement, correction, love, and accountability with one another.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together.” —Hebrews 10:24–25</li>
    <li>“Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” —Galatians 6:2</li>
    <li>“Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.” —Proverbs 27:17</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worship (Personal and Corporate) – Honoring God</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Worship is a lifestyle of glorifying God—both in corporate gatherings and in private devotion. While we honor Him with our lives, we are also commanded to sing to Him. Singing with our brothers and sisters in the church is one of the closest glimpses we have of Heaven on Earth.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” —John 4:24</li>
    <li>“Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.” —Hebrews 13:15</li>
    <li>“Addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart.” —Ephesians 5:19</li>
    <li>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly… singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.” —Colossians 3:16</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Service – Faith in Action</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Maturity means becoming more like Christ, who came not to be served but to serve. Each of us has been given specific gifts to serve others for His glory.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.” —Mark 10:45</li>
    <li>“As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace.” —1 Peter 4:10</li>
    <li>“Do not grow weary in doing good.” —Galatians 6:9</li>
    <li>“For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works…” —Ephesians 2:10</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reflection:</h3>
  <p>Spiritual disciplines are not a checklist to earn favor with God—they are a means by which we grow in grace. God uses them to shape us into the likeness of His Son. Growth takes intentional effort, time, and consistency.</p>
  <p><em>Are you training yourself for godliness? Which discipline is most neglected in your life right now?</em></p>

  <h3>Closing Prayer:</h3>
  <p>Lord, thank You for the means You’ve given us to know You more deeply. Help us to delight in Your Word, be faithful in prayer, grow in fellowship, worship You in spirit and truth, and serve others with joy. Make us more like Jesus. Amen.</p>
