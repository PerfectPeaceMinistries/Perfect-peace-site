    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #e9f8f3; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #94bfa3;">
      “So Abraham called the name of that place, ‘The Lord will provide’; as it is said to this day, ‘On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.’”<br>
      — Genesis 22:14 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>
      The name <strong>Jehovah Jireh</strong> appears only once in Scripture—Genesis 22:14—where Abraham names the place where God provided a ram in place of Isaac. It means <em>“The LORD will provide.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In one of the most dramatic and faith-testing moments in biblical history, Abraham obeys God's command to sacrifice his beloved son. Just as he is about to act, God intervenes and provides a ram. This wasn’t merely provision for a need—it was divine substitution. And it foreshadowed something far greater to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jehovah Jireh is not just the God who provides in the moment, but the God who sees ahead and makes a way. On that same mountain range, centuries later, God would provide the ultimate sacrifice: Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. The cross is the ultimate expression of Jehovah Jireh.
    </p>

    <p>
      This name speaks to God’s intimate knowledge of our needs and His perfect timing in meeting them. Whether it’s daily bread, wisdom, strength, shelter, or salvation—God sees and supplies.
    </p>

    <h2>Supporting Scriptures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genesis 22:8</strong> – “God will provide for himself the lamb…”</li>
      <li><strong>Genesis 22:14</strong> – “The Lord will provide.”</li>
      <li><strong>Philippians 4:19</strong> – “My God will supply every need of yours…”</li>
      <li><strong>Romans 8:32</strong> – “He who did not spare his own Son… will he not also… give us all things?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In what area of your life are you asking God to provide?</li>
      <li>How does the cross reassure you that God will not withhold what is truly needed?</li>
      <li>Are you willing to trust God's timing and method of provision?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>
      Jehovah Jireh, my faithful Provider, I praise You for always seeing and knowing what I need. Teach me to rest in Your timing and trust Your heart. Thank You for providing Your Son—the Lamb who takes away my sin. Help me walk in faith, confident that You will never fail to provide what is best. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
