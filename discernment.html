      “But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.”<br>
      — Hebrews 5:14 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <p>Discernment is one of the most critical yet often neglected virtues in the Christian life. It is the God-given ability to distinguish not just the obvious choices between right and wrong, but the subtle differences between what is almost right and what is truly biblical—not between black and white, but between light gray and the bright white of truth.</p>

    <h2>🔍 What Is Discernment?</h2>
    <p>Biblical discernment is the Spirit-empowered ability to recognize truth and error, even when error comes cloaked in “Christianese”—familiar phrases, emotional appeals, or half-truths that sound good but are not rooted in Scripture.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Discernment is not knowing the difference between right and wrong. It is knowing the difference between right and almost right.”<br>
      — Charles Spurgeon
    </blockquote>

    <p>False teachers rarely come waving red flags. Instead, they come as wolves in sheep’s clothing (Matthew 7:15), subtly twisting Scripture (Genesis 3:1), using impressive words and emotional appeal without sound doctrine (Romans 16:18).</p>

    <h2>📖 Key Scriptures on Discernment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> — “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.”</li>
      <li><strong>Philippians 1:9–10</strong> — “And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent…”</li>
      <li><strong>Proverbs 14:15</strong> — “The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.”</li>
      <li><strong>Romans 12:2</strong> — “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God…”</li>
      <li><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:21–22</strong> — “But test everything; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛡 Why Discernment Matters</h2>
    <p>We live in an age where false teachers are abundant—and often popular. Their teachings are attractive: they use Scripture selectively, emphasize personal fulfillment, and avoid offending listeners. They shy away from hard truths like the heinous nature of sin, the call to deny self, or God’s wrath and judgment.</p>

    <p>They tickle ears with what people want to hear, allowing them to feel comfortable remaining in sin. Their message lacks the cross. It lacks repentance. It lacks Christ’s Lordship and the call to holiness.</p>

    <p>Without discernment, we become vulnerable to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distorted gospels (Galatians 1:6–9)</li>
      <li>Self-help sermons labeled as biblical truth</li>
      <li>Prosperity messages that substitute comfort for holiness</li>
      <li>Misapplied verses that lead to false assurance or spiritual apathy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌱 How Do We Grow in Discernment?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “…those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice…”<br>
      — Hebrews 5:14
    </blockquote>

    <p>Discernment is not just a gift—it’s a muscle. It grows through use. And it is nearly impossible to maintain without faithfully practicing our spiritual disciplines. Only when we know and understand what is true can we clearly identify what is false.</p>

    <p>Grow your discernment through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily Bible Reading — Know God’s truth so well that counterfeits become obvious.</li>
      <li>Prayer — Ask the Spirit for clarity, wisdom, and conviction.</li>
      <li>Sound Teaching — Sit under faithful, expository preaching.</li>
      <li>Testing What You Hear — Don’t accept everything that “sounds right.”</li>
      <li>Christian Community — Mature believers can help you spot error when you
