    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“For we walk by faith, not by sight.”<br>— 2 Corinthians 5:7 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>The Christian life is often described as a “walk”—a steady, ongoing journey with God. But Paul makes it clear that this walk is not guided by what we can see or measure, but by faith. Faith is not wishful thinking or blind optimism; it is trust in the God who is sovereign, faithful, and true.</p>

    <p>Walking by faith means moving forward when the path is unclear. It is choosing obedience when circumstances tempt us to doubt. Abraham left his home without knowing where he was going because he trusted the One who called him (Hebrews 11:8). Peter stepped out of the boat, onto the water, because his eyes were on Jesus (Matthew 14:29). Their actions remind us that faith always requires risk—stepping into what cannot be explained by sight alone.</p>

    <p>The challenge is that our natural tendency is to lean on what we see, what we understand, and what feels secure. Yet faith invites us to shift our dependence from ourselves to God. It is an active confidence that His promises are sure, even when present circumstances seem contrary. As Charles Spurgeon once said, “Faith obliterates time, annihilates distance, and brings future things at once into its possession.”</p>

    <p>Walking by faith is not a single step—it is a daily practice. It shapes how we make decisions, endure trials, and wait on the Lord. Each step of trust strengthens our confidence in Him, until we realize that He has been faithful all along.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What areas of your life are you tempted to rely more on sight than on faith?</li>
      <li>How can you remind yourself daily of God’s promises, especially when circumstances feel uncertain?</li>
      <li>Who in Scripture inspires you to walk more boldly by faith?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, teach me to walk by faith and not by sight. Help me to trust Your promises even when I cannot see the outcome. Strengthen my heart to obey You in the small steps each day, and remind me that You are always faithful. May my life be marked by confident trust in You, for Your glory. Amen.</p>
