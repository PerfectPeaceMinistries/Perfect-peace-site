    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”<br>— 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>At the heart of the gospel lies a great exchange — the sinless One standing in the place of sinners. This is the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the cornerstone of redemption. From the moment Adam fell, humanity has stood guilty and condemned under the righteous judgment of a holy God. Justice demanded satisfaction. Yet mercy desired reconciliation. Only at the cross do these meet perfectly. The cross shouldn’t show us of our great worth, but rather of the heinous nature of our sin, and what it took to atone for it.</p>

    <p>Christ did not merely sympathize with sinners; He stood in their stead. He bore our guilt and shame, suffered our punishment, and endured the wrath of God that our sins deserved. Isaiah foretold this truth: “He was pierced for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities… and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:5–6).</p>

    <p>Every lash, every nail, every cry of anguish was not simply the cruelty of men — it was the justice of God being satisfied. The cup Christ drank was the one we had filled. The cross was not a tragic accident but a divine transaction: our debt transferred to the Son, and His righteousness imputed to us through our faith.</p>

    <p>To deny substitution is to empty the cross of its power. To embrace it is to fall in worship before the holy mystery of grace — that the sinless Christ became sin for us so that we might be declared righteous in Him. This is not sentiment; it is salvation. The wrath we deserved has been spent, the record of debt nailed to the tree, and peace with God secured forever.</p>

    <p>Let us never grow numb to that glory. Each time we confess our sins, each time we take the bread and the cup, we remember this truth: Christ stood where we should have stood, and died that we might live.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I truly see my sin as deserving of God’s wrath — and Christ’s death as my only hope?</li>
      <li>How can the reality of substitutionary grace deepen my worship and my gratitude today?</li>
      <li>What does it mean for me to live as one whose debt has been paid in full?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, I thank You for sending Your Son to bear the punishment that was mine. I deserved Your wrath, yet Christ took my place. Let this truth humble me, break me, and fill me with joy. Teach me to live each day under the shadow of the cross — forgiven, loved, and clothed in the righteousness of Christ. In His name I pray, amen.</p>
