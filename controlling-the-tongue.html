    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.”<br>— Ephesians 4:29 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    
<p>Words are powerful. Scripture tells us that “death and life are in the power of the tongue” (Proverbs 18:21). As followers of Christ, our speech is one of the most visible ways our faith is revealed to the world. What we say — and how we say it — matters deeply to God.</p>

<p>We are called to be different. If our words sound just like the world’s — sarcastic, critical, careless, or full of gossip — how will anyone know we belong to Christ? The world tears down, mocks, exaggerates, and slanders. But the Christian is called to speak in a way that builds others up and reflects the kindness of Christ.</p>

<p>James reminds us that the tongue is a fire — a small member, but capable of great destruction (James 3:5–6). With it we bless God and curse people made in His image — and that should not be so (James 3:9–10). God calls us to speak with gentleness, patience, humility, and grace. Our words should encourage, strengthen, and speak truth in love — not tear down, discourage, or spread harm.</p>

<p>Gossip is one of the most subtle and dangerous ways we misuse our speech. It often masquerades as concern or curiosity, but at its root is the desire to spread information that does not belong to us. Scripture warns:</p>

<blockquote>“Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered.” — Proverbs 11:13</blockquote>

<p>Spreading rumors — even true ones — can destroy reputations, divide churches, and grieve the Holy Spirit. If we are not part of the problem or the solution, we should not be part of the conversation.</p>

<p>Slander, rumors, complaining, sarcasm, and negativity have no place in the speech of a believer. The world has plenty of that. We are called to be different — to speak life. Jesus said that we will give an account for every careless word we speak (Matthew 12:36). That is not meant to scare us, but to sober us. Words matter.</p>

<p>Instead, let your speech be a source of healing, not harm. Let your words be marked by gentleness, not harshness. Speak hope, not cynicism. Speak peace, not conflict. Speak grace, not gossip.</p>


    
<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Have your words lately built up others or torn them down?</li>
  <li>Are there patterns of speech — sarcasm, gossip, criticism — that God is calling you to repent of?</li>
  <li>What habits could help you use your tongue to encourage and speak life?</li>
</ul>


    
<h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
<p>Lord, forgive me for every careless, critical, or harmful word I’ve spoken. Cleanse my heart, and help me to speak words that reflect Your kindness and truth. Let my tongue be used for blessing, not cursing — for building up, not tearing down. Teach me to be gentle in speech, wise in silence, and faithful to speak life. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
