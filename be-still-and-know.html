    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!”<br>— Psalm 46:10 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>The world around us never stops moving. Our days are filled with constant motion—notifications, conversations, obligations, noise. Even in our so-called “quiet” moments, we often turn to screens and scrolling. But Psalm 46:10 offers a different instruction: <em>Be still.</em> Stop striving. Cease the frantic pace. Step away from the noise.</p>

    <p><em>Be still</em> isn’t a suggestion—it’s a command. We must have our quiet time. It is critical for our souls and essential for our spiritual well-being. Make time for it.</p>

    <p>My favorite time to meet with God has always been in the early mornings—when the house is still, the sun is just beginning to rise, and the birds are singing. It’s the perfect time to sit quietly with the Lord. I can enjoy my coffee, open the Scriptures, and soak in His Word without distraction.</p>

    <p>Stillness is not just about physical rest—it’s about spiritual posture. To “be still” means to surrender our attempts at control and acknowledge that <em>He is God, and we are not.</em> It is in stillness that our hearts can finally hear what the hustle drowns out: the gentle voice of the Shepherd.</p>

    <p>Jesus modeled this beautifully. Though crowds pressed in, though needs were constant, He regularly withdrew to quiet places to pray (Luke 5:16). He understood what we so often forget—that communion with the Father is not found in chaos, but in solitude.</p>

    <p>Stillness isn’t laziness or inactivity. It’s intentional time set apart to know the Lord. When we slow down, we begin to see more clearly. We remember that God is sovereign over every detail of our lives. We find peace in His presence, clarity in His Word, and rest for our weary souls.</p>

    <p>You don’t need a mountain retreat to be still—you just need a few moments of undistracted focus. Step outside. Sit in silence. Open your Bible. Turn off the noise. And meet with God.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What is keeping you from being still before God today?</li>
      <li>How can you create space for silence and solitude this week?</li>
      <li>Do you trust that God is working, even when you stop striving?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, in a world full of noise and demands, teach me to be still. Help me to slow down, to lay down my burdens, and to meet You in the quiet. I want to know You more deeply—not just through activity, but in rest. You are God, and I trust You. Let Your peace rule in my heart as I draw near to You. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
