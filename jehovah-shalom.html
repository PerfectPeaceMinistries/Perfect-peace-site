    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>“Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, The Lord Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.”<br>— Judges 6:24 (ESV)</blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p><strong>Jehovah Shalom</strong> appears only once in Scripture, during a time of deep fear and national oppression. Israel had turned from the Lord, and as judgment, they were being crushed by the Midianites. In this moment, God appeared to Gideon and called him to be a deliverer.</p>

    <p>Understandably, Gideon was overwhelmed. When he realized he had encountered the Lord, he feared he would die. But God said, <em>“Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.”</em> (Judges 6:23). In response, Gideon built an altar and called it <strong>Jehovah Shalom</strong> — “The LORD is Peace.”</p>

    <p>This name is not about the absence of conflict but the presence of divine wholeness. God's peace is not circumstantial—it transcends the chaos. It’s a peace that steadies the soul in the middle of battle, fear, or doubt. He is the God who brings calm to storms and rest to restless hearts.</p>

    <p>The fullness of this name is revealed in Jesus Christ. He is the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6), and through Him, we are reconciled to God. Paul writes, “He Himself is our peace” (Ephesians 2:14). In Christ, we have peace with God (Romans 5:1), peace within, and peace that overflows to others.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you truly rest in the peace God offers, or do you rely on your circumstances for calm?</li>
      <li>Where in your life do you need to be reminded that the Lord is your peace?</li>
      <li>How can you bring this peace to those around you today?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Jehovah Shalom, You are my peace. In a world of noise, fear, and chaos, anchor my heart in Your presence. Let me not seek peace in the things of this world, but in You alone. Help me walk in the calm assurance of Your sovereignty and extend that same peace to others. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
