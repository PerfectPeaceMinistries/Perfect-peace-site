    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.”<br>— Proverbs 14:12 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>From the very beginning, man has desired autonomy. In the Garden, Adam and Eve were given perfect fellowship with God, yet the serpent’s lie — “you will be like God” — appealed to something deep within them: the desire to rule their own lives.</p>

    <p>That same desire echoes through every generation. We want to define our purpose. We chase what feels right. We follow our instincts, our dreams, our ambitions. We build plans and shape futures based on our own reasoning. But Scripture offers a sobering warning: “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.”</p>

    <p>This is not just about wrong behavior — it’s about wrong direction. A person can be sincere, passionate, and determined… and still be heading toward destruction. The danger lies in trusting our natural instincts apart from the guidance of God. The way that seems right is often paved with pride, self-will, and worldly logic.</p>

    <p><em>“The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.”<br>— Proverbs 16:9 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p>We plan — but God overrules. We walk — but God directs. The humble heart learns to submit every intention to the will of the Lord. This isn’t passivity. It’s faith. We actively seek, but we also surrender. We move, but we listen. We pray not just “Lord, bless my plans” but “Lord, replace them if You must.”</p>

    <p><em>“A man’s steps are ordained by the Lord; How then can a person understand his way?”<br>— Proverbs 20:24 (NASB2020)</em></p>

    <p>It’s a mystery — and it’s meant to be. We’re not sovereign. We don’t see the full picture. God’s path may be narrow, slow, or painful, but it’s good. It leads to life. It leads to peace. It leads to Christ.</p>

    <p>The Bible doesn’t say, “Follow your heart.” It says, “Deny yourself.” Jesus calls us to lose our life for His sake so that we might truly find it. To walk in the Spirit is to walk away from our self-made paths and to trust that God’s way is not only better — it’s perfect.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Are there paths in your life you’ve pursued because they seem right, but haven’t been surrendered to God?</li>
      <li>In what areas do you need to trade autonomy for obedience?</li>
      <li>How might the Spirit be prompting you to let go of your plans and trust in God’s perfect will?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, I confess that I often trust in my own judgment. I make plans without You. I chase dreams that don’t include You. Forgive my pride and self-will. Help me to lay down my need for control and walk by Your Spirit. Teach me to trust the path You have for me, even when I don’t understand it. Guide my steps, correct my course, and lead me into life — not death. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
