    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“He has made everything beautiful in its time.” — Ecclesiastes 3:11a (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Waiting is never easy. We live in a world of instant gratification—where delays feel like denials and slowness seems like silence. But Scripture calls us to a better way: a life of trust in the sovereign timing of God.</p>

    <p>God’s timing is never off. He is not late, though we often feel impatient. He is not withholding, though we may feel forgotten. The truth is, God is always at work behind the scenes, preparing us for what He has prepared for us.</p>

    <p>Ecclesiastes 3:11 reminds us that “He has made everything beautiful in its time.” Not in our time. Not when we think it should happen. But in His time. And His timing is perfect—not only for the outcome, but also for the shaping of our hearts along the way.</p>

    <p>Think of Abraham waiting decades for Isaac. Or Joseph waiting in prison for his deliverance. Or David waiting to become king. These weren’t wasted years—they were sacred seasons of refining and preparing. The delay didn’t mean God had forgotten; it meant God was building something deeper.</p>

    <p>When we rush ahead, we may miss the good work God is doing in us as we wait for what He will do through us. Trusting His timing is an act of surrender. It’s saying, “Lord, I believe You know best—even when I don’t understand.”</p>

    <p>So if you find yourself in a season of waiting, take heart. Your times are in His hands (Psalm 31:15). His plans for you are good (Jeremiah 29:11). And in due season, you will reap—if you do not give up (Galatians 6:9).</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What areas of your life are hardest to surrender to God’s timing?</li>
      <li>How can you practically cultivate trust and patience during a season of waiting?</li>
      <li>Can you recall a time when God’s delay proved to be a blessing in hindsight?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, help me to rest in Your perfect timing. Forgive me for the times I have doubted You or tried to take matters into my own hands. Teach me to wait with hope, to trust You deeply, and to believe that You are working all things for my good. Even when I can’t see it, help me believe You are near. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
