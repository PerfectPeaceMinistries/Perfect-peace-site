    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!”<br>— Psalm 27:14 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>There are seasons in the Christian life when it feels like our prayers go unanswered and God’s voice is distant. We ask, we plead, we seek—and yet all we seem to hear is silence. In those moments, our faith is tested. Will we keep trusting when we cannot see the next step?</p>

    <p>Waiting on the Lord is not passive idleness. It is an active trust, a steadfast holding to His promises when our circumstances tempt us to let go. David wrote Psalm 27:14 out of a life filled with trials—years of running from enemies, enduring false accusations, and facing uncertainty. Yet he could still say, “Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage.”</p>

    <p>God’s delays are not denials. His silence may be the space in which He deepens our dependence on Him, strengthens our spiritual muscles, and aligns our hearts with His will. Like a seed in the soil, much of God’s work is hidden from sight until the right time.</p>

    <p>As we wait, we are called to be strong—not in our own strength, but in His. We are called to take courage—not because the path ahead is clear, but because the One who leads us is faithful. If God seems silent today, remember that He is never absent. His timing is perfect, His ways are higher, and His purposes are unfolding exactly as He intends. Wait for the Lord. Trust His heart. He will not fail you.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Am I using this waiting season to draw nearer to God, or am I growing restless and discouraged?</li>
      <li>Which specific promises of God can I meditate on to strengthen my heart today?</li>
      <li>How can I practice active trust this week—through prayer, obedience, or serving others—while I wait?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, teach me to wait well. When Your voice seems silent, help me to trust that You are still working for my good and Your glory. Give me the strength to be patient, the courage to keep believing, and the faith to hold fast until Your purposes are revealed. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
