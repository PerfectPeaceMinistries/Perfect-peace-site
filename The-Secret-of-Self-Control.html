    <h1>The Secret of Self-Control</h1>">

    <p><em>“A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.” — Proverbs 25:28 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p>There are many ways in which we distinguish ourselves from unbelievers, but perhaps one of the most telling is self-control. Maturity is often measured by the degree of self-control a person exhibits.</p>

    <p>Take young children, for example: they tend to act impulsively, with very little self-control. As they grow, they learn to restrain themselves. The same is true in our spiritual lives. At the beginning of our walk with God, we are often weak and self-serving. But as we mature, the Spirit produces greater self-control within us.</p>

    <p>Self-control is not about mere willpower—it’s about submission. It’s about obedience and allowing the Spirit to lead us. Without it, we become vulnerable to every temptation, impulse, and emotion that comes our way.</p>

    <p><strong>But praise God:</strong></p>

    <p><em>“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.” — 2 Timothy 1:7 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p>True self-control comes not from trying harder, but from surrendering more fully to the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p><em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.” — Galatians 5:22–23 (ESV)</em></p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <p>Reflection:  
        Do you have room to grow in your self-control? What area of your life feels like a city without walls?  
        Ask the Spirit today to build His strength there.</p>
