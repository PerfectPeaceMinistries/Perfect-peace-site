    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” — 2 Corinthians 12:9 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>We often view weakness as something to hide—a flaw that makes us less useful in God’s kingdom. We offer excuses for why we can’t do more: <em>If only I weren’t so introverted, surely I could fellowship more, lead, and teach. If only I were better off financially, then I could give more. If only…</em></p>

    <p>But Scripture reveals the opposite. Our weakness is the very stage on which God’s power is displayed most clearly. When we succeed in areas where we are naturally weak, it becomes unmistakable that it is only by God’s grace. He receives all the glory, for we know we could not have done it on our own.</p>

    <p>When Paul pleaded with the Lord to remove his “thorn in the flesh,” God’s answer was not deliverance but grace—grace that would sustain him and magnify Christ’s strength through his frailty.</p>

    <p>This truth is woven throughout the Bible. God called Moses, who stuttered, to speak before Pharaoh. He chose Gideon, who felt unfit, to lead Israel’s army. He sent David, a shepherd boy, to face a giant warrior. Time and again, God delights to use the weak and unlikely so that His glory—not human ability—shines brightest.</p>

    <p>In our own lives, weakness reminds us of our dependence. We cannot save ourselves, nor can we endure faithfully in our own strength. But when we admit our insufficiency, we make room for Christ’s all-sufficient power. Every failure, every limitation, and every struggle can become the very place where His strength shines brightest. And when, day by day, we remain faithful despite our weakness, Christ alone gets the glory.</p>

    <p>So instead of despising weakness, we can rejoice in it, knowing it is there that we meet God’s enabling grace. As Paul declared, “For when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Corinthians 12:10).</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where do I feel weak today?</li>
      <li>Instead of asking God to remove it, how might He be using it to reveal His strength?</li>
      <li>How can my weakness become a testimony to His power?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, I confess my weakness before You. I cannot do this life in my own strength. Thank You that Your grace is sufficient and Your power is made perfect in my frailty. Teach me to boast not in myself, but in You, so that Your glory may be displayed in all I do. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
