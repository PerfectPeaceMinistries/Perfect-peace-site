      <h2>Regeneration: The New Birth</h2>

      <h3>Key Verses:</h3>
      <div class="kv">
        <p>“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” — <em>Titus 3:5 (KJV)</em></p>
        <p>“And you were dead in the trespasses and sins… But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved.” — <em>Ephesians 2:1, 4–5 (ESV)</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>Term:</h3>
      <p><strong>Regeneration</strong> (παλιγγενεσία, <em>paliggenesia</em>) — “restoration” or “rebirth.”</p>

      <h3>Definition:</h3>
      <p>Regeneration is the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit by which the spiritually dead sinner is made alive to God. It is an act of divine grace that imparts new life, enabling the sinner to respond in faith and repentance. This transformation is not the result of human effort, merit, or will, but solely of God’s mercy and power.</p>

      <h3>Explanation:</h3>
      <p>The Greek term <em>paliggenesia</em> combines <em>palin</em> (“again”) and <em>genesis</em> (“birth” or “beginning”), literally meaning “new birth” or “renewal.” Scripture presents regeneration as the divine act that brings spiritual life where there was only death. Before this work of God, the sinner is utterly unable to seek or please Him—“dead in trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1). He is unable to understand spiritual things at all. But God, moved by His mercy and love, breathes life into the soul.</p>
      <p>This new birth is not a moral improvement or a fresh resolve to do better—it is the creation of a new nature. It changes the heart’s disposition toward God, replacing rebellion with affection, blindness with sight, and death with life. Regeneration is instantaneous and entirely monergistic—meaning it is accomplished by God alone. The human will plays no part in initiating it; rather, it is the result of God’s initiative and grace.</p>

      <h3>Application:</h3>
      <p>The fruit of regeneration is repentance and faith—not the other way around. We do not believe in order to be born again; we believe <em>because</em> we have been born again. Just as a newborn cannot take credit for his birth, so the child of God cannot boast in his conversion. The evidence of regeneration is seen in a transformed heart, a renewed mind, and a desire to obey God.</p>
      <p>This truth should humble us deeply. God moved us from darkness to light, from death to life. Salvation begins not with our will, but with God’s mercy. The same Spirit who hovered over the waters of creation now breathes new life into the human heart, bringing light where there was darkness and love where there was none.</p>

      <h3>Reflection:</h3>
      <p>Have you experienced this new birth? Regeneration is not something we manufacture; it is something we receive. Those whom God has made alive are forever changed—their desires, affections, and pursuits are made new. Reflect on the miracle of grace that caused your dead heart to beat again.</p>

      <h3>Prayer:</h3>
      <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the mercy that found me when I was dead in sin. You made me alive together with Christ and gave me a heart that beats for You. Help me to walk in the power of the Spirit, bearing the fruit of the new life You have given. May others see in me the evidence of Your regenerating grace. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
