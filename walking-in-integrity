      <p>
        Integrity is the backbone of a credible Christian witness. It means being the same
        person in private as we are in public—living in such a way that our actions,
        choices, and character reflect the God we profess. To walk in integrity is to live
        truthfully, consistently, and humbly before both God and man.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world doesn’t just listen to what we say—it watches how we live. Actions speak
        louder than words. We can preach holiness, repentance, and the power of the gospel,
        but if we live in hypocrisy, our message falls flat. Worse, we dishonor the name of
        Christ and become a stumbling block to others. <em>A gospel that does not change
        the one who preaches it will never convince the one who hears it.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Integrity matters because it shows the world that the gospel is real. If Christ
        truly lives in us, then the world should see Him in how we speak, how we treat
        others, how we handle temptation, and how we respond when no one is watching. The
        transformed life is living evidence of a true disciple.
      </p>

      <p>
        No believer who is walking in the light, in close fellowship with God, has anything
        to hide. Integrity is about transparency—walking honestly before the Lord,
        confessing sin when we fall, and striving by grace to live righteously. A clean
        conscience gives us boldness, peace, and credibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are called to be holy as God is holy (<a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A16&version=ESV"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Peter 1:16</a>). Not perfect, but genuine. When we
        fall short, we repent sincerely. When we succeed, we give God the glory. Either
        way, we live openly and truthfully, because we fear God more than man.

      <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
      <p>
        Lord, You see all things. Help me to walk in integrity—not just in what I say, but
        in how I live. Let my life reflect the holiness of Christ. Guard me from hypocrisy,
        cleanse me from hidden sin, and give me courage to live in the light. May my
        witness be strong because my walk is sincere. In Jesus’ name, amen.
