    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.”<br>— Revelation 3:16 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>God does not speak lightly when it comes to lukewarm faith. In Revelation 3:16, Jesus delivers a sobering warning to the church in Laodicea—a people who professed faith but lacked genuine spiritual fire. “Because you are lukewarm… I will spit you out of my mouth.” These are not the words of mild disapproval; they are words of rejection. But what does this mean for us?</p>

    <p>This is not a statement about losing salvation due to a lack of good works. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. However, this warning is a call for deep, honest self-examination. Do we have a living faith that treasures Christ above all? Is Jesus truly our greatest love and highest priority—or have we become entangled in the comforts and distractions of this world? Are we walking in the Spirit, bearing the fruits of righteousness, or are we gratifying the desires of the flesh?</p>

    <p>Seasons of weakness, doubt, or even backsliding can and do occur in the life of a true believer. But those who belong to Christ are never abandoned to sin. The Holy Spirit is at work continually sanctifying us, convicting us, and shaping us into the image of Jesus. True faith produces perseverance and growth in holiness over time.</p>

    <p>The warning in Revelation refers to a different kind of person—those caught in the great apostasy. These are not simply struggling Christians. They are those who may attend church, recite the right creeds, and claim Christian identity, yet have never been born again. Their faith is intellectual, but not transformational. They know of God, but they do not know Him. They profess Christ with their lips, but their hearts remain unchanged. They bear no fruit, and their lives show no evidence of genuine repentance.</p>

    <p>Hebrews 6:4–6 speaks of such people as “impossible to restore again to repentance.” This is not because God is unwilling to forgive, but because these individuals have hardened their hearts after receiving the truth and have never truly yielded to the Lord. Their rejection of the Spirit is final. It is a terrifying warning—and it is meant to be.</p>

    <p>Scripture pleads with us to be sure of our salvation. Examine your heart. Not to live in fear or constant anxiety, but to test whether your faith is real (2 Corinthians 13:5). The evidence of true salvation is not perfection, but a transformed life marked by love for Christ, hatred for sin, and increasing obedience.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is my faith marked by passion for Christ or comfort in the world?</li>
      <li>Am I bearing fruit that points to genuine transformation?</li>
      <li>Do I love Jesus above all else, or is He an afterthought?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, I don’t want to be lukewarm. I want to burn with passion for You. Help me to examine my heart and cast out all that is false. Give me eyes to see the beauty of Christ, and a heart that treasures Him above everything. Let my life show clear evidence of salvation. Keep me from apathy. Lead me in holiness. May I walk in the Spirit and live for Your glory alone. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
