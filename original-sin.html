      <h2>Original Sin</h2>

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <blockquote>“Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—” — Romans 5:12 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” — Psalm 51:5 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.” — Psalm 53:3 (ESV)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“And you were dead in the trespasses and sins” — Ephesians 2:1 (ESV)</blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>Original sin refers to the inherent sinful nature of mankind, passed down through the father and traced all the way back to Adam. When Adam sinned, he acted as the representative head of the human race, causing all who descend from him to be born fallen, corrupted, and spiritually dead. This doctrine teaches that humans are not sinners because they sin; rather, they sin because they are sinners by nature. In short, original sin explains what is fundamentally wrong with the human race—the very problem Christ came to solve.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p><strong>Inherited Corruption.</strong> David’s confession in Psalm 51:5 does not imply that his mother sinned in conceiving him. Rather, it reveals that from the very moment of conception, every human being inherits a heart inclined toward evil rather than righteousness. Our corruption is not learned behavior; it is present from birth.</p>

      <p><strong>Inherited Guilt.</strong> Paul’s teaching in Romans 5:12 makes clear that Adam’s sin is imputed to all humanity. Death—both physical and spiritual—entered the world through Adam, and because he stood as our representative, we share in the consequences of his fall. This explains why infants die, why all people sin, and why the curse rests on creation.</p>

      <p><strong>Universal Impact.</strong> Original sin explains the universal brokenness of the world. Every sinful act, every impure thought, and every rebellion against God flows from this corrupted root. Apart from grace, the human heart is spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1) and unable to submit to God’s law (Romans 8:7–8).</p>

      <p><strong>The Need for Redemption.</strong> Without understanding original sin, the gospel loses its meaning. Christ came not merely to correct our outward behaviors but to address the fundamental problem of the human condition—a sinful nature inherited from Adam. Where Adam failed, Christ, the “Second Adam,” prevailed (Romans 5:18–19).</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>A right understanding of original sin humbles us. It removes every trace of self-righteousness or confidence in the will of man by reminding us that our problem is not only what we do but who we are apart from Christ. It frees us from the illusion that we can fix ourselves through effort, morality, or discipline. Instead, it drives us to the only true hope—God’s regenerating grace.</p>
      <p>This doctrine also calls believers to view others with compassion, recognizing that all people share this common fallen condition. Original sin reminds us of our lifelong need for sanctifying grace; though redeemed, we still battle the lingering presence of sin until glorification.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How does the doctrine of original sin help you understand your own struggles with temptation and weakness?</li>
        <li>In what ways does this doctrine deepen your appreciation for Christ as the Second Adam?</li>
        <li>How does knowing humanity’s shared corruption help you respond to others with patience and grace?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Father,<br>
      I confess that from birth I have been a sinner, helpless and unable to save myself. I thank You that Your mercy reaches deeper than my corruption and that where Adam failed, Christ triumphed. Grant me humility to recognize my need, faith to rest in Your grace, and strength to pursue holiness through the power of Your Spirit. Shape my heart to reflect the righteousness of Christ until the day when all traces of sin are finally removed.<br>
      Amen.</p>
