    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.”<br>— James 1:2–3 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>The Christian life is not marked by the absence of suffering, but by a transformed perspective in the midst of it. James does not say “if” trials come, but “when.” Trials are not accidents in the believer’s life; they are instruments in the hand of a loving God. Each circumstance—whether sorrow or gladness, pain or peace—is being used by the Father to shape us into the likeness of His Son.</p>

    <p>Joy in trials does not mean we enjoy pain itself. Instead, it means we see beyond the hardship to the purpose behind it. God’s Word tells us that “the testing of your faith produces steadfastness” (James 1:3). Trials refine us, much like fire refines gold, removing impurities and strengthening what remains. Paul reminds us that “we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope” (Romans 5:3–4).</p>

    <p>When we embrace trials with faith, they become opportunities to know Christ more deeply. Our joy springs not from our situation, but from our Savior, who promises that “for those who love God all things work together for good” (Romans 8:28). In every season, we can say with confidence: these trials are not wasted. They are necessary steps in God’s gracious work of conforming us to the image of Christ.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How have recent challenges shaped your walk with Christ?</li>
      <li>In what ways can you shift your perspective to see your trials as tools in God’s hands rather than obstacles?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, teach me to find joy not in what I see, but in what You are doing through every circumstance. Give me eyes of faith to trust that every trial has a purpose and that You are using all things to conform me to the image of Your Son. Strengthen my heart to endure with joy, knowing that You are faithful and Your work in me will not fail. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
