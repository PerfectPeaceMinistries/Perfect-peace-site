      <h2>Mediation</h2>
      <img src="IMG_0868.jpeg" alt="Christ as the bridge between God and man" />

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,”<br>
        — 1 Timothy 2:5 (ESV)
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “Christ is the mediator of a new covenant…”<br>
        — Hebrews 9:15 (ESV)
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A mediator is someone who stands between two parties in conflict or separation, working to reconcile them.
        In Scripture, the Greek term <em>μεσίτης</em> (<em>mesitēs</em>) refers to one who acts as a go-between, securing peace,
        agreement, or restored fellowship. Another related concept is intercession—the act of pleading on behalf of another.
        As our Mediator, Jesus continually pleads our case before the Father.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Only Jesus Christ can fulfill this role between God and humanity.</strong></p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        Sin created an unbridgeable divide between a holy God and fallen man. No human effort, law-keeping, sacrifice,
        or moral striving could span the gulf. We were, as Paul says, “alienated and hostile in mind” (Colossians 1:21).
        But God, in His mercy, appointed a Mediator—His own Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The image of a bridge captures this doctrine vividly. Humanity stands on one side in its guilt; God’s holiness
        stands on the other. The distance is vast, the waters deep, and the separation real. Yet Christ lays Himself down
        as the only way across.
      </p>

      <h3>What Christ’s Mediation Accomplishes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>He reconciles us to God.</strong> Through His death, Christ removes the barrier of sin and brings us into restored fellowship with God (Romans 5:10–11).</li>
        <li><strong>He establishes the New Covenant.</strong> Hebrews 9:15 shows that Christ mediates not merely peace, but a new and better covenant—one grounded in His own blood.</li>
        <li><strong>He represents us before the Father.</strong> As our Advocate (1 John 2:1), Christ continually intercedes for us on the basis of His finished work.</li>
        <li><strong>He gives us access to God.</strong> The torn veil testifies that through Christ we are welcomed into God’s presence with confidence (Hebrews 10:19–22).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Christ is not simply the builder of the bridge—He is the bridge.</em></p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>
        The doctrine of mediation is not abstract theology; it is the foundation of our daily peace with God.
        We have access to God’s presence because of and through Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When guilt accuses, we rest not in our performance, but in our Mediator.</li>
        <li>When we pray, we do not come trembling and unsure, but boldly through Christ.</li>
        <li>When we feel far from God, the truth remains unchanged: the bridge has already been built.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the bridge that spans two worlds with calm certainty. Where do you feel separated from God right now?
        Where do you sense weakness, guilt, or distance? In those very places, Christ’s mediating work shines brightest.
        He does not ask you to build your way back. He simply calls you to come.
      </p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        Lord Jesus, my only Mediator, thank You for bridging the divide my sin created.
        Thank You for reconciling me to the Father through Your blood and for securing a new covenant that can never be broken.
        Teach me to draw near with confidence, to rest in Your finished work, and to live as one who has been brought safely across.
        Strengthen my faith, deepen my gratitude, and let me never forget that You are the Way. Amen.
