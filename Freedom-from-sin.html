    <p>In a world that worships independence, the gospel offers a greater freedom—freedom from sin. Through Christ, we are not only freed from the punishment of hell or the weight of guilt and shame; we are also set free from the power of sin itself. We are brought into a new life marked by purpose, holiness, and the promise of eternity.</p>

    <p>To be a “slave of God” is not bondage—it is true freedom. It is the grace-enabled ability not to do whatever we please, but to do what we ought to do—things that glorify God. Our lives are now governed by grace, directed by righteousness, and filled with the Spirit’s sanctifying work. We no longer live for ourselves, but for the One who died and rose again for us.</p>

    <p>This freedom does not lead to emptiness—it leads to fruit: fruit that grows in character, flourishes in service, and matures into eternal life.</p>

    <p>So today, walk in that freedom—not to drift aimlessly, but to follow Christ faithfully. For true freedom is found in full surrender.</p>
