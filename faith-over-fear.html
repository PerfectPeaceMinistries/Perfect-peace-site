    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” — 2 Timothy 1:7 (KJV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>We all have crosses to bear in this life—burdens uniquely shaped for each of us. They are not random; they are necessary for conforming us to Christ.</p>

    <p>Mine is bipolar disorder, and I recently experienced a manic episode that turned psychotic. Psychosis is a loss of touch with reality, leaving a person confused and frightened. It’s an awful experience I would never wish on anyone. Not only is it terrifying, but it also leaves you trying to make sense of everything once you come out of it. Naturally, I asked God what He meant by it. What was I to learn? Why did He send it to me?</p>

    <p>Then I’m reminded of 2 Timothy 1:7. My psychosis and fear were not sent by God. God does not give confusion or fear—He gives a sound mind.</p>

    <p>Fear is one of the enemy’s favorite weapons. It whispers lies that cause us to doubt God’s goodness, question His promises, and shrink back from the calling He has placed on our lives. Yet Scripture reminds us that fear does not come from God.</p>

    <p>To walk in faith is to live in the confidence that our God reigns. He holds every circumstance in His hands. When fear begins to rise, we must remember who dwells within us. The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead now lives in us (Romans 8:11). That Spirit gives us courage when we feel weak, love when our hearts grow cold, and calm when anxiety stirs.</p>

    <p>Faith doesn’t mean the absence of fear—it means choosing to trust God even when fear tries to take control. When Peter stepped out of the boat onto the water, he began to sink only when he took his eyes off Jesus. In the same way, when we fix our gaze on Christ, we find steady ground even in the storm.</p>

    <p>Like my psychosis of confusion and fear, whatever you face today—uncertainty, danger, or worry—remember that fear is not your master. The Spirit of God empowers you to stand firm, to act in love, and to think clearly. Let faith rise above fear. The One who called you is faithful, and just as He delivered me, He will not fail you.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What fears have been trying to control your thoughts or decisions lately?</li>
      <li>How can you actively remind yourself of the Spirit of power, love, and a sound mind within you?</li>
      <li>In what areas of life is God calling you to step out in faith instead of retreating in fear?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for giving me not a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. When fear tries to grip my heart, remind me of who You are and who I am in Christ. Help me to walk boldly in faith, knowing that You go before me and stand beside me. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
