    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” — Matthew 5:14–16 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet.” — Matthew 5:13 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Jesus uses two vivid images to describe His disciples: <em>light</em> and <em>salt.</em> Both reveal the radical difference that the gospel makes in our lives.</p>

    <p>As light, we are called to shine in the midst of a dark and broken world. Darkness represents sin, confusion, and hopelessness. Left to itself, the world has no source of true light. But Christ, the Light of the world, has made His followers reflectors of His brightness. Our words, actions, and attitudes are meant to point others to Him. A hidden or dimmed light fails in its purpose; so too, a Christian who blends into the world’s ways robs others of the hope of Christ.</p>

    <p>As salt, we are called to preserve and add flavor. Salt prevents decay and brings out the richness of food. Spiritually, Christians act as a preserving influence in society—restraining evil, promoting good, and pointing to God’s truth. Salt also makes people thirsty. In the same way, a life marked by Christ’s love and holiness should stir in others a longing to know Him.</p>

    <p>If we lose our saltiness—if we compromise with the world, dilute the truth, or hide our distinctiveness—our witness loses its power. The world does not need more of itself; it desperately needs the difference Christ brings.</p>

    <p>To shine as lights and remain salty in a tasteless world requires courage, humility, and dependence on the Spirit. The goal is not to draw attention to ourselves, but that others may “see [our] good works and give glory to [our] Father who is in heaven.” Our lives become living testimonies of God’s grace—visible, preserving, and impactful.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where in your daily life are you tempted to hide your light instead of letting it shine?</li>
      <li>In what ways can you bring “saltiness” to your workplace, family, or community this week?</li>
      <li>How might your life awaken a thirst in others for the hope of Christ?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, You have called us to be salt and light in this world. Forgive us for the times we have hidden our faith or compromised our witness. Strengthen us by Your Spirit to shine brightly and to preserve faithfully, so that others may see You through us. May our lives point people to Your truth, Your grace, and Your glory. Amen.</p>
