    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.” — Isaiah 26:3 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” — Philippians 4:7 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>I talk about peace often. Isaiah 26:3 has long been my favorite verse in Scripture. When I founded this ministry, I couldn’t think of a better name than what God Himself promises to His children: <em>perfect peace.</em> The peace of God. Peace that holds steady no matter the circumstances.</p>

    <p>We live in a world marked by uncertainty, conflict, and personal struggles. Troubles come in many forms—illness, loss, financial strain, relational pain, or even the daily burdens that press on our hearts. Left on our own, we might easily be overwhelmed. But God promises something extraordinary: peace.</p>

    <p>This is not peace as the world gives, which is fleeting and fragile. Rather, it is the peace of God—deep, abiding, and beyond our comprehension. Isaiah 26:3 reminds us that this perfect peace is given to those whose minds are fixed on the Lord in trust. The key is focus. When our thoughts remain on the storm, the storm grows larger. But when our thoughts remain on Christ, His presence grows larger than any storm.</p>

    <p>Paul echoes this truth in Philippians 4:7, assuring believers that God’s peace will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. This peace acts like a protective shield, steadying us when fear or anxiety tries to intrude. Even when we cannot explain it, we can experience it—a peace that truly surpasses understanding.</p>

    <p>Trials will not vanish overnight. Yet in the midst of them, God offers us His presence and His peace. It is possible to walk through the fire and not be consumed, to stand in the flood and not be swept away, because the Prince of Peace is with us. We hold the promise that it will always be well with our soul. As the old hymn reminds us: “When sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.”</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where are you tempted to fix your mind today—on the storm, or on Christ?</li>
      <li>What practical step can you take this week to redirect your thoughts to God’s promises when anxiety rises?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for offering us a peace that this world cannot give and cannot take away. When trials come, help us fix our minds on You and trust in Your goodness. Guard our hearts with Your peace, and let our lives reflect Your calming presence to those around us. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
