    <h1>The Fear of the Lord: Foundation of Wisdom</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.”<br>— Proverbs 9:10 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>In our day, the phrase “fear of the Lord” is often misunderstood. To some, it sounds harsh or even oppressive. But biblically, it is neither. It is not a cringing terror that drives us from God—it is a holy reverence that draws us to Him. It is awe in the presence of infinite majesty. It is the trembling joy of knowing you are standing before the One who made the stars—and yet calls you by name.</p>

    <p>The fear of the Lord is not contrary to love—it is part of it. You cannot love a God you do not revere. You cannot obey a God you do not respect. And you will not trust a God you treat lightly.</p>

    <p>Scripture is clear: the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10), it leads to life (Proverbs 19:23), and it keeps us from evil (Proverbs 16:6). This kind of fear is what drove Moses to remove his sandals at the burning bush. It’s what caused Isaiah to cry out, “Woe is me!” when he saw the Lord high and lifted up. It’s what made the disciples fall down in worship when Jesus calmed the storm.</p>

    <p>We do not need more flippant religion or casual Christianity. We need hearts that tremble before the holiness of God—hearts that know He is not to be trifled with, yet trust Him completely.</p>

    <p>God is not merely our helper or friend—though He is both. He is also the righteous Judge of all the earth. He dwells in unapproachable light. And yet, in Christ, we are invited near—not with fear of punishment, but with reverence and worship.</p>

    <p>To fear the Lord is to live in constant awareness of His glory, His power, His presence, and His authority. It is to say with your life: “He is God. I am not.”</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I live with a deep awareness of God's majesty and holiness?</li>
      <li>How might a right fear of the Lord affect the way I speak, think, and live?</li>
      <li>Have I lost a sense of awe in my walk with God?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, teach me to fear You rightly—not with dread, but with reverence. Let my heart bow before Your holiness and my life reflect Your greatness. May I never treat You lightly. Help me walk in the wisdom that flows from fearing You. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
