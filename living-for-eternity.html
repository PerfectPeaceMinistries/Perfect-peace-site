    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.”<br>— Colossians 3:2 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>This world is not our home. As believers, we are citizens of Heaven—sojourners passing through a fallen world on our way to glory. The Apostle Paul reminds us in Colossians to <em>set our minds on things that are above</em>, not the fleeting cares and comforts of earth. Our gaze must be lifted, our hearts fixed on the eternal.</p>

    <p>Paul expands this thought in Philippians 4:8:<br><em>“Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.”</em></p>

    <p>These are the things of Heaven—the things that endure, the things that reflect the character of our Savior. We are called to meditate on what is holy, to walk in purity, and to live with eternity in view.</p>

    <p>The Christian life is not aimless. We press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14). This world tempts us with temporary pleasures, but the true believer knows that these are passing shadows. What matters is not how comfortable we are here—but how faithful we are to Christ.</p>

    <p>Jesus said, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matthew 6:21). If our treasure is in Heaven, then our hearts will be anchored there as well. Our choices, our values, our time—all should reflect that we are living for what is eternal.</p>

    <p>Let us hold loosely to the things of this world and live each day in light of forever. The finish line is ahead. Our inheritance is secure. And Christ, our great reward, is waiting.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where do I tend to set my mind—on earthly things, or things above?</li>
      <li>What would change in my life if I truly believed Heaven was my home?</li>
      <li>Am I living like a traveler passing through, or like a settler trying to build here?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, lift my eyes from the distractions of this world and help me to fix my heart on Heaven. Remind me daily that I am just passing through, and that my true citizenship is with You. Teach me to treasure what is eternal and to live for what truly matters. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
