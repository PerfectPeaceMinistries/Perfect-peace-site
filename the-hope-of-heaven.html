    <p><strong>Key Verses:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”<br>— Philippians 3:14 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.”<br>— 1 Corinthians 9:24 (ESV)</em></p>
    <p><em>“Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.”<br>— Philippians 4:8 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Life in this world is filled with distractions, hardships, and temptations that compete for our attention. Yet as followers of Christ, we are called to lift our eyes beyond the fleeting trials of today and fix them firmly on the eternal prize—the kingdom of heaven. Paul speaks of pressing on “toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 3:14). This imagery reminds us that our journey is not aimless but purposeful, with heaven as our destination.</p>

    <p>The believer’s inheritance is nothing less than eternal fellowship with Christ in His kingdom. Unlike the fading riches of this world, our heavenly inheritance is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading (1 Peter 1:4). With this hope before us, we are urged to run our race with endurance, disciplining ourselves as athletes do—living with self-control, sacrifice, and perseverance. As Paul writes, “Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it” (1 Corinthians 9:24). Our whole lives are meant to be shaped by the calling of Christ and the promise of His kingdom.</p>

    <p>Yet our minds can easily drift toward anxiety, bitterness, or worldly pursuits. Scripture calls us instead to dwell on what is true, honorable, pure, and lovely (Philippians 4:8). When our thoughts are shaped by the goodness of God and His promises, our hearts are strengthened to persevere. Keeping our minds fixed on the things above lifts us above the distractions of this life and anchors us in eternal hope.</p>

    <p>Heaven is not a distant dream but the sure reality promised by Christ. Let us live each day as citizens of that kingdom, pressing on with joy, knowing the crown of righteousness awaits all who love His appearing (2 Timothy 4:8).</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What daily habits can help me fix my mind on the hope of heaven?</li>
      <li>Am I running my race with endurance, or growing weary in the distractions of life?</li>
      <li>Which promises of God most strengthen my heart when I grow discouraged?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, help me to keep my eyes fixed on You and the eternal prize You have promised. When I grow weary or distracted, remind me of the hope of heaven and the joy of Your presence. Teach me to set my mind on what is good, pure, and worthy of praise, so that my life may bring glory to You until the day I see You face to face. Amen.</p>
