    <h1>Growing in Godliness – The Role of Spiritual Disciplines</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <div class="date">June 13, 2025</div>

    <p><strong>“Train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way.”</strong><br>
    —1 Timothy 4:7b–8a</p>

    <h3>Prayer – Communing with God</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Prayer is our lifeline to God. It expresses dependence, adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Colossians 4:2</li>
      <li>1 Thessalonians 5:17</li>
      <li>James 5:16b</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bible Study – Hearing from God</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Scripture is the primary way we hear from God. It renews our minds and helps us grow in wisdom and righteousness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Timothy 3:16</li>
      <li>1 Peter 2:2</li>
      <li>Psalm 119:105</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Church Fellowship – Living in Community</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> God calls us into a spiritual family where we grow through encouragement, correction, love, and accountability with one another.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hebrews 10:24–25</li>
      <li>Galatians 6:2</li>
      <li>Proverbs 27:17</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Worship (Personal and Corporate) – Honoring God</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Worship is a lifestyle of glorifying God—both in corporate gatherings and in private devotion. Singing with our brothers and sisters in the church is one of the closest glimpses we have of Heaven on Earth.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>John 4:24</li>
      <li>Hebrews 13:15</li>
      <li>Ephesians 5:19</li>
      <li>Colossians 3:16</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service – Faith in Action</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Maturity means becoming more like Christ, who came not to be served but to serve. Each of us has been given specific gifts to serve others for His glory.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mark 10:45</li>
      <li>1 Peter 4:10</li>
      <li>Galatians 6:9</li>
      <li>Ephesians 2:10</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>Spiritual disciplines are not a checklist to earn favor with God—they are a means by which we grow in grace. God uses them to shape us into the likeness of His Son. Growth takes intentional effort, time, and consistency.</p>
    <p><em>Are you training yourself for godliness? Which discipline is most neglected in your life right now?</em></p>

    <h3>Closing Prayer:</h3>
    <p>Lord, thank You for the means You’ve given us to know You more deeply. Help us to delight in Your Word, be faithful in prayer, grow in fellowship, worship You in spirit and truth, and serve others with joy. Make us more like Jesus. Amen.</p>
