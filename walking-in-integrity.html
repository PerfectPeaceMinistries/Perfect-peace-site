    <h2>Key Verse</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out.” —Proverbs 10:9 (ESV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Integrity is the backbone of a credible Christian witness. It means being the same person in private as we are in public—living in such a way that our actions, choices, and character reflect the God we profess. To walk in integrity is to live truthfully, consistently, and humbly before both God and man.</p>
    <p>The world doesn’t just listen to what we say—it watches how we live. Actions speak louder than words. We can preach holiness, repentance, and the power of the gospel, but if we live in hypocrisy, our message falls flat. Worse, we dishonor the name of Christ and become a stumbling block to others. <em>A gospel that does not change the one who preaches it will never convince the one who hears it.</em></p>
    <p>Integrity matters because it shows the world that the gospel is real. If Christ truly lives in us, then the world should see Him in how we speak, how we treat others, how we handle temptation, and how we respond when no one is watching. The transformed life is living evidence of a true disciple.</p>
    <p>No believer who is walking in the light, in close fellowship with God, has anything to hide. Integrity is about transparency—walking honestly before the Lord, confessing sin when we fall, and striving by grace to live righteously. A clean conscience gives us boldness, peace, and credibility.</p>
    <p>We are called to be holy as God is holy (1 Peter 1:16). Not perfect, but genuine. When we fall short, we repent sincerely. When we succeed, we give God the glory. Either way, we live openly and truthfully, because we fear God more than man.</p>

    <h2>Scripture for Meditation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Matthew 5:16 —</strong> “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</li>
      <li><strong>1 John 3:18 —</strong> “Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.”</li>
      <li><strong>Proverbs 11:3 —</strong> “The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.”</li>
      <li><strong>2 Corinthians 4:1–2 —</strong> “Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways… by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Does my private life match the message I proclaim publicly?</p>
    <p>Are there areas of my life I’m hiding, avoiding, or excusing?</p>
    <p>How might my example affect others’ view of Christ?</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Lord, You see all things. Help me to walk in integrity—not just in what I say, but in how I live. Let my life reflect the holiness of Christ. Guard me from hypocrisy, cleanse me from hidden sin, and give me courage to live in the light. May my witness be strong because my walk is sincere. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
