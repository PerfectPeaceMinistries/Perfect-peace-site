      <h2>Justification</h2>

      <h3>Key Verse</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” — Romans 5:1 (ESV)
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>Justification is the gracious act of God by which a sinner is declared righteous eternally through faith in Jesus Christ, His atoning sacrifice, and resurrection, not on the basis of any works, but solely based on Christ’s righteousness imputed to them.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>While being justified includes the forgiveness of sins— it goes beyond that. It is to be legally declared righteous in the sight of God, a label that lasts for eternity. This declaration is a legal verdict from the Judge of all the earth. Though we are guilty, God counts us righteous because Christ’s perfect obedience and sacrificial death are credited to our account. This is not a process but a moment — a divine transaction that happens the instant faith is placed in Christ. Through this, our standing before God changes forever: from condemned to accepted, from enemy to beloved child.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>Justification frees the believer from striving to earn God’s favor. We no longer live under the burden of condemnation or fear of judgment, because we have assurance of an eternal righteous standing before God. When the enemy whispers accusations, we look to the cross and remember — the case is closed, and the verdict is in: righteous in Christ. This truth produces humility, gratitude, and peace, as well as a renewed desire to walk in holiness out of love, not obligation.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Every attempt to earn God’s approval is a denial of justification by faith. True joy flows only from resting in what Christ has already accomplished. When we grasp that our acceptance is unchanging because it rests in Him, our hearts find deep and lasting peace.</p>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Lord, thank You that in Christ, I am justified — fully accepted and declared righteous in Your sight. Teach me to live in the freedom and joy of this truth. When I doubt or stumble, remind me that my standing is secure because of Your grace alone. Amen.</p>
