    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”<br>— 1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Prayer is more than a moment—it is a lifeline. The Apostle Paul’s command to “pray without ceasing” is not a call to constant verbal repetition, but to live in continual awareness of and communion with God. Persistent prayer is the steady rhythm of the believer’s heart, turning to God in joy, in need, in gratitude, and in dependence.</p>

    <p>The power of constant prayer lies in its ability to align our will with God’s. When we are consistent in seeking Him, we find our thoughts shaped by His Word, our desires refined by His Spirit, and our strength renewed by His presence. Persistent prayer does not change God’s mind; it changes our hearts.</p>

    <p>Jesus Himself modeled this for us, often withdrawing to pray—even in seasons of intense ministry. The parable of the persistent widow in Luke 18 reminds us that God delights in the faith that refuses to give up. When we pray constantly, we are declaring our trust in His wisdom, timing, and goodness.</p>

    <p>The believer who prays without ceasing walks through life aware that God is near, ready to guide, comfort, and strengthen. And in that nearness, we find peace that surpasses understanding.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Are your prayers consistent or sporadic?</li>
      <li>What simple rhythms (morning, commute, mealtime, bedtime) can anchor prayer in your day?</li>
      <li>How has persistent prayer changed your perspective in a recent trial?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, teach me to live in continual communion with You. Let my first instinct be to turn to You in every situation—whether in joy or in trouble. Shape my desires to match Your will, and help me to trust Your timing and Your ways. Thank You for hearing me always, not because of my worth, but because of Christ. Amen.</p>
