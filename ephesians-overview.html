    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>The book of Ephesians was written by the Apostle Paul, likely around A.D. 60 during his first imprisonment in Rome. It is one of four letters known as the “Prison Epistles,” alongside Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. Though Paul was in chains, the words he wrote in Ephesians soar with spiritual richness and heavenly perspective.</p>

    <p>Ephesians is distinct in style — more formal and exalted in tone than many of Paul’s other letters. It contains no specific personal greetings, leading some scholars to believe it may have been intended as a circular letter, passed among several churches in the region of Asia Minor.</p>

    <p>The letter is divided into two major sections.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chapters 1–3:</strong> Deeply theological, focusing on God’s eternal purpose and grace. Paul unveils the mystery of the gospel: that both Jew and Gentile are united into one body through Christ. These chapters describe our adoption, redemption, and inheritance in Him — highlighting God’s sovereign work in salvation.</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 4–6:</strong> Practical instruction on how believers are to “walk worthy of the calling.” This includes unity in the church, purity in life, godliness in relationships, and standing firm in spiritual warfare.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The central theme of Ephesians is the <strong>cosmic unity of all things in Christ</strong>. Paul lifts our gaze to a broader vision of God’s redemptive plan — a plan set in motion before the foundation of the world and fulfilled in Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>Ephesians is both <em>deeply theological</em> and <em>intensely practical</em>. It reminds us who we are in Christ — chosen, loved, redeemed — and calls us to live in a manner worthy of that grace. The believer who studies this letter finds their identity reshaped, their mind renewed, and their steps redirected to walk in love, light, and wisdom.</p>
