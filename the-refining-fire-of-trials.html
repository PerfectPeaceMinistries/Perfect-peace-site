    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”<br>— 1 Peter 1:6–7 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>No one naturally enjoys trials. They are uncomfortable, exhausting, and often bring us to the end of ourselves. Yet Scripture teaches that trials are not meaningless interruptions to our lives—they are God’s chosen tools to shape us into the image of His Son.</p>

    <p>Peter reminds us that trials are <em>necessary</em>. Why? Because without them, our faith would remain untested, and untested faith is often shallow and fragile. Just as gold is refined in the heat of the furnace, our faith is purified through the fires of hardship. The impurities of pride, self-reliance, and worldly attachments are burned away, leaving behind a stronger, more steadfast trust in the Lord.</p>

    <p>James tells us to “count it all joy” when we meet trials (James 1:2–4). This joy is not found in the pain itself, but in the purpose behind it—God is conforming us to the image of Christ. Jesus Himself “learned obedience through what He suffered” (Hebrews 5:8), and as His disciples, we walk the same path. Every trial is an invitation to lean on His strength, trust His wisdom, and reflect His character.</p>

    <p>When we understand that trials are not working <em>against</em> us but <em>for</em> us, we can endure with hope. The fire may be hot, but the Refiner’s hands are steady. He will not waste a single tear, and on the day of Christ’s return, our tested and proven faith will shine for His glory.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What current trial in your life might God be using to refine your faith?</li>
      <li>How can you respond in a way that draws you closer to Christ rather than away from Him?</li>
      <li>What impurities might God be purging from your heart through this season?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord, thank You that my trials are not wasted. Even when I don’t understand, I trust that You are working all things for my good and for Your glory. Burn away anything in me that does not honor You, and make me more like Christ through every challenge I face. Keep me steadfast in the fire, knowing that You are with me and will bring me through. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
