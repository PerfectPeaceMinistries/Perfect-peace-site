    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”<br>— Galatians 6:2 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>

    <p>God never intended for the Christian life to be lived in isolation. From the beginning, He created us for community—first with Himself, then with one another. The local church is not merely a place we attend; it is the family of God, the body of Christ, a living fellowship of believers walking together in truth and love. Paul’s words in Galatians 6:2 are simple, yet profound: “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”</p>

    <p>The “law of Christ” is the law of love. Jesus said that all the commandments are summed up in loving God and loving our neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). When we bear one another’s burdens, we are walking in that love—imitating the compassion and self-giving nature of our Lord.</p>

    <p>We all carry burdens. Sometimes they’re obvious—grief, financial struggle, family conflict, illness. Other times, they’re hidden—spiritual dryness, secret sin, emotional exhaustion, fear. God designed the church as a place where these burdens can be shared, not hidden. We are to “rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep” (Romans 12:15). That means entering into each other’s lives deeply enough to know the burdens—and to be willing to help carry them.</p>

    <p>The local church is where this happens. It’s where we pray for one another, encourage one another, confess sin to one another, and serve one another. It’s where we link arms with fellow believers and say, “You’re not alone. I’m with you.” In doing this, we become tangible expressions of Christ’s love and care.</p>

    <p>This burden-bearing isn’t always convenient. It requires humility, sacrifice, time, and vulnerability. It’s easier to stay distant, to keep relationships shallow and safe. But that is not the way of Christ. Jesus bore our greatest burden—our sin—on the cross. If He did not avoid our deepest need, how can we ignore the needs of our brothers and sisters?</p>

    <p>To bear one another’s burdens is to image Christ. It is to fulfill His law. And it is one of the greatest blessings of being connected to the body of Christ. We are not saved into solitude—we are saved into a family, where love is shown in action.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Am I meaningfully connected to a local body of believers?</li>
      <li>Do I know the burdens others are carrying, and am I helping to lift them?</li>
      <li>Have I allowed others to come alongside me in my own struggles?</li>
      <li>Am I fulfilling the law of Christ by walking in sacrificial love?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Scriptures:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.” — John 13:34</li>
      <li>“Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.” — Philippians 2:4</li>
      <li>“Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.” — 1 Thessalonians 5:11</li>
      <li>“Two are better than one… For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow.” — Ecclesiastes 4:9–10</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, You bore my greatest burden on the cross. Thank You for giving me a spiritual family to walk alongside. Teach me to love deeply, serve willingly, and carry the burdens of others with compassion and grace. Help me not to isolate, but to invest in the lives of those You’ve placed around me. May my life be marked by the law of Christ—the law of love. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
