<h2>Expiation</h2>

<h3>Key Verses</h3>
<p>“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.” — 1 Peter 2:24 (ESV)</p>
<p>“For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.” — Psalm 103:11–12 (ESV)</p>
<p>“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away (αἴρων) the sin of the world!” — John 1:29 (ESV)</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p><strong>αἴρων (airōn)</strong> — to take away, remove, or lift up.</p>
<p>Expiation refers to the removal, cleansing, or taking away of sin. Whereas atonement describes Christ satisfying God’s justice by paying sin’s penalty, expiation focuses on what His sacrifice accomplishes for us — namely, the complete removal of our guilt and the cleansing of our sin. Because of expiation, through our faith, God is able to look upon us as innocent, purified, and fully accepted as His children.</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>When we examined atonement, we emphasized that Christ bore our sins, satisfying God’s righteous wrath and fulfilling the demands of divine justice. Atonement deals with what God did — justice satisfied, wrath appeased, sin paid in full.</p>
<p>Expiation is the complementary truth that addresses the effect that has on us. Our sins are taken away, removed, cleansed, and carried far from us.</p>

<p>The Old Testament sacrificial system displayed this vividly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blood on the altar dealt with the atoning side — sin’s price paid.</li>
<li>The scapegoat on the Day of Atonement illustrated expiation — the removal of sin from the camp (Leviticus 16:21–22).</li>
</ul>

<p>In Christ, both images reach their perfect fulfillment. He is the sacrifice whose blood satisfies God’s justice, and He is the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world.</p>

<p>Because of Christ’s expiatory work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our sins are not merely forgiven; they are removed.</li>
<li>Our guilt is not merely pardoned; it is cleansed.</li>
<li>Our record is not merely amended; it is wiped clean.</li>
<li>We stand before God not as tolerated sinners, but as washed, purified, fully accepted children of God.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expiation highlights the transforming effect of Christ’s sacrifice on the believer. Our shame is lifted. Our guilt is removed. Our sin no longer defines us.</p>

<h3>Application</h3>
<ul>
<li>Live as one whose sin has been fully removed. Shame no longer has authority over your identity.</li>
<li>Draw near to God with confidence, knowing the weight of your sin has been carried away by Christ.</li>
<li>Pursue holiness, not to become clean, but because Christ has already made you clean.</li>
<li>Reject every voice of condemnation that tries to resurrect sins Christ has removed “as far as the east is from the west.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Your sin has not only been paid for — it has been carried away.<br>
Do you still think of yourself in terms of past failures?<br>
Do you live more aware of your sin than of Christ’s cleansing?<br>
How should your daily walk change in light of the truth that your guilt is gone?</p>

<h3>Prayer</h3>
<p>Father, thank You for removing my sin through the perfect work of Christ. Thank You that through His sacrifice my guilt has been taken away, my shame lifted, my record cleansed. Help me walk in the freedom, purity, and confidence that come from being washed clean by the blood of the Lamb. Let me never forget the fullness of Your mercy — not only that You have forgiven me, but that You have removed my sin forever. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
