    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”</em><br>—Philippians 1:6 (ESV)</p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>The Christian life is not marked by perfection, but by progress. Sanctification is the ongoing work of God in the heart of every true believer — shaping us, molding us, and conforming us into the image of Christ. It is not instantaneous. It is not without struggle. It is not without failure. But it is real.</p>

    <p>Too often, believers grow weary because they do not see the rapid transformation they expect. They look at their faults, their sins, their inconsistencies — and they despair. But Scripture never promises instant maturity. Instead, it promises that God will complete what He started. Not overnight. But surely.</p>

    <p>We are called to strive after holiness, to put to death what is earthly in us, to hunger and thirst for righteousness — but even our effort is fueled by His grace. The same God who justifies us also sanctifies us. He does not leave us to finish the race on our own. He strengthens, disciplines, and carries us. The progress may feel slow, but it is sure — because He is faithful.</p>

    <p>If you feel stuck, dry, or ashamed of how far you still have to go — lift your eyes to Jesus. He is not surprised by your weakness. He is patient. He is at work. He is not done.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you focusing more on your failures than on God’s faithfulness?</li>
      <li>Can you identify areas of your life where God has grown you in the past year?</li>
      <li>What daily habits might help you stay rooted in the grace that produces growth?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Father, thank You for Your patience with me. I confess that I often grow discouraged when I don’t see instant change. But You are not finished with me. Help me to walk in the assurance that You are working, even when I don’t feel it. Teach me to delight in progress, not perfection — and to trust that You will complete the good work You’ve begun in me. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
