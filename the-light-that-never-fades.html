    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’” — John 8:12 (ESV)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>

    <p>Even though we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light, a temporal darkness can still settle over us quietly. It can take the form of sorrow in the loss of a loved one, fear, confusion, or even spiritual weariness. For me, it often comes through depression—and I know many others feel it too. Sometimes it’s the heaviness that lingers in the heart long after a storm or battle has passed. Yet in that very darkness, Jesus speaks a word of promise: “I am the light of the world.”</p>

    <p>Christ doesn’t merely bring light—He <strong>is</strong> the light. His presence exposes lies, dispels fear, and brings clarity where there was confusion. Just as the sun drives out the night, His truth drives away despair. The closer we draw to Him, the more we begin to see the world as it truly is: under the steady rule of a sovereign and loving God. Every episode of depression I’ve endured has eventually ended with Christ reminding me of His light and delivering me from despair.</p>

    <p>When we wander into the shadows of doubt or sin, His light does not fade. It follows us, gently leading us back to grace. Even in our lowest valleys, the radiance of Christ is never extinguished. Scripture tells us that in heaven there will be no need for sun or lamp, “for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb” (Revelation 21:23). The light we cling to now is eternal.</p>

    <p>So when your soul feels dim, lift your eyes to Him who never darkens. Christ is not a distant glow—He is near, shining within every heart that trusts Him. His light is our comfort in the night and our guide toward everlasting day.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <p>What shadows have dimmed your sense of hope lately? Bring them into the light of Christ through prayer. Remember: the darkness cannot overcome Him.</p>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon the corners of my heart where fear and doubt still linger. Remind me that Your light never fades and Your love never fails. Lead me through the night, and help me walk each day in the brightness of Your truth. Amen.</p>
