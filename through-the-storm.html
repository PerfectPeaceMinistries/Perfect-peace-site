    <p><strong>Key Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“…We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.”</em><br>—Romans 5:3–4 (ESV)</p>

    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
    <p>Storms are not random disruptions in the Christian life—they are part of God’s refining process. He does not waste our suffering. In fact, trials are necessary. Every hardship is a chisel in the hand of the Master Sculptor, shaping us into the image of His Son.</p>

    <p>Christ Himself was made perfect through suffering (Hebrews 2:10), and we are not above our Master. If we are to be glorified with Him, we must also be willing to suffer with Him. This is not punishment—it is preparation.</p>

    <p>When the winds howl and the waves crash, our faith is tested and revealed. When we are broken and can see no way forward, it is there we find the grace that carries us. We learn to depend on God. We come to understand more clearly that we cannot stand in our own strength. We are fully dependent on Him.</p>

    <p>Trials expose what is weak, unstable, and false—so that only what is eternal may remain. Like gold in a furnace, our impurities rise to the surface so that God might purify us and make us more like Christ.</p>

    <p>His strength is made perfect in our weakness. His glory shines brightest in our most fragile moments. These storms are not meaningless—they are the means by which God prepares us for eternal glory.</p>

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What storms have revealed your need for God’s strength lately?</li>
      <li>Have you seen growth, maturity, or humility come out of past suffering?</li>
      <li>Are you resisting the trial—or receiving its refining purpose?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Prayer:</h2>
    <p>Lord Jesus, You suffered before me, and now You suffer with me. When I feel weak, remind me that Your grace is sufficient. When I walk through the fire, purify my heart. Use every trial to make me more like You. I surrender to Your will. Refine me, strengthen me, and be glorified in me. Amen.</p>
