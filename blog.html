    <h1>About the Ministry</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>In 2020, I was led to begin a ministry on social media. It started with a Facebook group, which quickly became the central hub of the ministry. I also shared content on Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and posted teaching videos on YouTube.</p>

    <p>About a year ago, however, I stepped away from the Facebook group. The daily stress of debate and hostility had begun to weigh heavily on me. While I loved teaching, the atmosphere had become more draining than edifying, and it was taking a personal toll.</p>

    <p>Instead of continuing in that format, I created a public page on Facebook where I could share lessons and devotionals without getting pulled into endless arguments. I no longer engage in debates—I simply give the lesson. I teach the Bible. And if anyone has genuine questions, I’m always eager to answer.</p>

    <p>When I first started the group, part of my intent was to avoid casting pearls before swine. I wanted my lessons to reach believers who would rightly value the truth of God’s Word. That same desire is what led to the creation of this site. I want these teachings to reach those who cherish sound doctrine and seek to apply it meaningfully to their lives. While I may still post occasionally on personal platforms, most of my content will now live here—where, Lord willing, it will be followed by those who are truly seeking biblical truth.</p>

    <p>This site will be different from the group I once ran. That group was an open forum for discussion, and I welcomed differing perspectives—so long as they did not reject the foundational doctrines of the Christian faith. But here, I do not intend to engage in debate. I may not even comment often. I will gladly answer sincere questions from those seeking understanding, but I will not be drawn into endless disputes. My passion is to teach and to edify the body of Christ. This page is not a battleground for theological sparring—it is a place for learning, reflection, and dwelling on the things of God.</p>

    <p>This is a ministry grounded in biblical truth and Reformed theology. It embraces the doctrines of grace and rejects free-will theology as false doctrine. It upholds the five solas of the Reformation and affirms monergism: that salvation, from beginning to end, is the work of God alone.</p>

    <p>All things exist for the glory of God. All things belong to Him and are used according to His will and purpose. God is sovereign. He is in control of all things and determines all things. Apart from Him, man can do no good. Every inclination of the human heart is evil continually. Only God is good. Any good comes from Him, and any good found in the believer is Christ in them.</p>

    <p>The saints endure. The saints overcome. The saints prevail. Eternal life is a gift that cannot be lost. God finishes what He begins.</p>

    <p>We are living in the last days—and have been since Christ ascended. Christ is coming soon. The time for repentance is now.</p>
