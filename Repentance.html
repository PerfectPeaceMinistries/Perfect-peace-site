    <h1>Repentance</h1>
    <h2>Turning Back to God – Understanding True Repentance</h2>

    <p><strong>Theme Verse:</strong></p>
    <p><em>“Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out.” —Acts 3:19</em></p>

    <h3>What Is Repentance?</h3>
    <p>Repentance is not merely regret or guilt. It is a Spirit-empowered response to sin that involves turning away from sin and turning toward God. It’s important to understand that repentance is a response to God—it is not something we produce by our own will. At the moment of our justification, when we first believed, God granted us repentance. So while repentance is something we do, it is entirely by God’s grace.</p>

    <p>The Greek word for repentance, <em>metanoia</em>, literally means a “change of mind”—but not just intellectually. It is a change of mind that leads to a change of heart, which leads to a change in action and lifestyle.</p>

    <p><strong>True repentance includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confession</strong> – acknowledging our sin before God</li>
        <li><strong>Contrition</strong> – genuine sorrow over sin</li>
        <li><strong>Turning</strong> – a decisive break from sin and a movement toward obedience</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Do We Repent?</h3>
    <p>We do not repent because we have fallen from grace or lost our salvation and union with God. We repent because we understand the heinous nature of sin against a holy God and what it cost Christ to atone for it. Repentance repairs the fellowship that sin disrupts. It is not a one-time event but a lifelong practice for the believer, because we all fall short daily. The true believer repents until his dying day. It is not a sign of weakness, but of spiritual maturity. It conveys to God that we take our sin seriously and are striving to grow in grace.</p>

    <h3>Key Scriptures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>“The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.” —Acts 17:30</li>
        <li>“Correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.” —2 Timothy 2:25</li>
        <li>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9</li>
        <li>“God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance.” —Romans 2:4</li>
        <li>“Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.” —Matthew 3:8</li>
        <li>“Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent.” —Revelation 3:19</li>
        <li>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.” —Psalm 51:10</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>Repentance is not the sign of a weak believer—it is the mark of a true one. It is not defeat, but the first step toward healing. Every time we repent, we are reminded of the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice and the mercy of our heavenly Father.</p>
        <p>Is there any sin you’re tolerating instead of turning from?</p>
        <p>What would it look like for you to repent sincerely today?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="closing-prayer">
        <h3>Closing Prayer:</h3>
        <p>Lord, You are holy and good. I confess my sin before You and ask You to cleanse me and renew me. Help me not to hide or justify my sin, but to turn from it and walk in obedience by Your grace. Thank You for the mercy that never runs dry and the cross that makes repentance possible. Amen.</p>
