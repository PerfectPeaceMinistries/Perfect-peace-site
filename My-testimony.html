    <h1>My Testimony</h1>
    <p>My name is Brian Jenkins, and this is my ministry.
All I want to do is teach the Word of God. It’s my passion. It’s my calling. I know firsthand the power of Scripture—it has saved me and transformed my life. The Word is alive, and I want to bring it to people. I want others to experience what I have. I long to see lives changed by the truth of God’s Word for His glory.</p>

<p>Believe me—it can happen. I’m living proof. By every natural measure, I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t be leading a ministry or proclaiming the gospel. I should be dead. A little over six years ago, I nearly was.</p>

<p>I was born in Roanoke, Virginia, in 1986... (text truncated for brevity)</p>

<p>God pulled me from the deepest pit and gave me new life—abundant life.</p>
<p><strong>God is good!!<br>
God is faithful!!<br>
God is worthy of our worship and praise!!</strong></p>
