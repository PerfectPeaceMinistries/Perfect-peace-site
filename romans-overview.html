    <h1>Romans: Book Overview</h1>

    <h2>Author:</h2>
    <p>The Apostle Paul is the author of Romans. He identifies himself by name in Romans 1:1, and the style, theology, and historical references match his other epistles. Paul was a former Pharisee radically transformed by Christ, now serving as a missionary to the Gentiles.</p>

    <h2>Audience:</h2>
    <p>The letter was addressed to the Christians in Rome—a mixture of Jewish and Gentile believers. This diverse audience is critical to understanding the themes of unity, grace, law, and justification that Paul addresses throughout the letter.</p>

    <h2>Date of Writing:</h2>
    <p>Romans was likely written around AD 56–58, during Paul’s third missionary journey while he was staying in Corinth (see Acts 20:2–3). It was delivered to Rome by Phoebe, a deaconess from the church in Cenchreae (Romans 16:1–2).</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Themes:</h2>
    <p>Paul had not yet visited the church in Rome, but he longed to do so (Romans 1:10–15). This letter served both as a personal introduction and a theological foundation for his upcoming visit. It is the most systematic and comprehensive explanation of the gospel of grace found in Scripture.</p>
    <p>Key themes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The universal guilt of humanity (Romans 1–3)</li>
      <li>Justification by faith alone (Romans 3–5)</li>
      <li>Sanctification and victory over sin (Romans 6–8)</li>
      <li>God’s sovereignty and Israel’s role (Romans 9–11)</li>
      <li>Practical Christian living (Romans 12–15)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Condition of the Roman Church:</h2>
    <p>At the time of writing, the Roman church was a growing community of both Jewish and Gentile Christians. After the emperor Claudius expelled Jews from Rome around AD 49 (see Acts 18:2), Gentile believers likely assumed leadership roles. When Jewish believers later returned under Nero’s rule, tensions developed over issues of law, tradition, and authority.</p>
    <p>Paul’s letter, in part, aims to unify the church, address divisions, and clarify that salvation is by grace through faith—not by works of the law—whether one is Jew or Gentile (Romans 3:29–30), and to make clear God’s sovereignty in salvation.</p>

    <h2>Tone and Style:</h2>
    <p>Romans is deeply theological yet profoundly pastoral. It is rich with deep truths about God and how He works, but it also gives practical, day-to-day instruction on living. While Romans will always be relevant in every believer’s life, what I personally love about this book is the weighty nature of the topics Paul addresses. Each time I return to this epistle, I find meaty truths that resonate more deeply as I mature. Much of what Paul writes in this book is directed to more mature believers.</p>
