        <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.”</p>

        <p>“And he said, ‘My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.’”</p>

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</p>
        <p><em>— Matthew 11:28–30 (ESV)</em></p>

      <h2 class="section">Devotion</h2>
      <p>As I relax here in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, I’m reminded of how deeply God loves us and how graciously He provides rest. Vacations allow us to step back from daily responsibilities, but Christ offers something far greater—true rest for our souls.</p>
      <p>God Himself rested on the seventh day, not because He needed it, but to give us an example. He commands us to rest, not for His benefit, but for ours. He designed us for daily renewal in His presence and a weekly rhythm of Sabbath.</p>
      <p>When the Lord gave Israel the Ten Commandments, the Sabbath was more than a pause from work—it was a gift. It was a time to stop striving, to remember our Creator, and to delight in His provision. The Sabbath reminds us that our worth is not tied to productivity but to belonging to Him. In a world that never stops pushing, Sabbath rest retrains our hearts to trust God’s care instead of our own effort.</p>
      <p>Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was made for our good. It is not a burden, but a gracious provision. God knows our limits and calls us to rest so that we may be restored. This rhythm—daily communion with Him and a weekly day set apart—refreshes our bodies, renews our minds, and realigns our hearts with His.</p>
      <p>As believers under grace, we are not bound by the law of the Sabbath, yet the principle remains. Just as we need daily quiet time with God, we also benefit from setting aside one day a week to focus on Him and experience His rest. True rest is not merely ceasing from work, but resting in Christ Himself, who invites us: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”</p>

      <h2 class="section">Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do I treat daily time with God as essential, or optional?</li>
        <li>How can I better guard one day each week as holy unto the Lord?</li>
        <li>In what ways have I experienced the peace that comes from resting in Christ?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section">Prayer</h2>
      <p>Father, thank You for the gift of rest. You know my limits, and You invite me to lay my burdens down. Teach me to seek You daily in quiet moments and to honor the Sabbath as a day of worship and renewal. Help me to find my rest in Christ alone, trusting that You are faithful to provide for all my needs. Amen.</p>
