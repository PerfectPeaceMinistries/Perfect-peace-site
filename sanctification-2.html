    <h1>Sanctification 2 — God at Work in You</h1>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Text:</strong> Philippians 2:12–13</p>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Sanctification is a lifelong process empowered by God’s grace and guided by our obedience.</p>

    <p>Sanctification is the lifelong process by which God makes believers more like Christ. It begins at the moment of conversion and continues throughout our lives until the day we are glorified. As 1 Thessalonians 4:3 states, “This is the will of God, your sanctification…” It isn’t an instant transformation but a journey that includes trials, temptations, struggles, and victories. God uses every circumstance in life to shape us into the image of His Son.</p>

    <p>We are not passive in this process. Paul exhorts us in Philippians to “work out your own salvation,” which doesn’t mean working for salvation, but rather living out the salvation already received. As James 2:17 reminds us, “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” Sanctification involves our obedience, effort, and the pursuit of spiritual discipline. Growth in holiness requires vigilance, intentionality, and reverence. We are called to obey.</p>

    <p>Yet, even as we work, we do not work alone. Paul continues in Philippians, “…for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.” God gives us not only the desire to do what pleases Him, but also the strength to carry it out. As Hebrews 13:21 affirms, He is “working in us that which is pleasing in his sight.” This truth anchors us. We don’t sanctify ourselves by our own strength—God empowers our obedience. That reality should give us confidence, not anxiety.</p>

    <p>The proper posture for the believer is awe, not fear. We live in the tension of effort and trust, action and surrender. We must avoid the extremes of legalism (depending entirely on our own effort) and passivity (assuming God will change us with no effort on our part). Galatians 5:25 provides helpful balance: “If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.” God invites us into a transforming partnership. He does not want us to fear failure, but to rejoice in His faithful work within us.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, we rest in the promise that God will finish what He starts. Philippians 1:6 assures us, “He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.” This means we can stay faithful in the small steps, trust God’s timing in our growth, and encourage others in their own journey of sanctification.</p>

    <p>Sanctification is not about perfection—it’s about progress. It is a Spirit-empowered journey where our obedience and God’s grace meet. Walk faithfully, knowing that He is working in you for His good pleasure.</p>
